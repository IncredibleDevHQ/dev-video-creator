# SVG Compatibility Contract Reference

The complete closed grammar that `svg_quality_checker.py` and the
`svg_to_pptx.py` exporter preflight enforce on generated SVG. The always-read
authoring rules — the canonical form the model writes — live in
[`shared-standards-core.md`](../../references/shared-standards-core.md) and
[`svg-effects.md`](../../references/svg-effects.md); this reference holds the
mapping tables, accepted-but-warned spellings, rejection boundaries, and
import-side behavior that those files no longer repeat. Enforcement is shared:
the checker imports the same validators as the exporter
(`svg_to_pptx/drawingml/utils.py`, `converter.py`, `text_properties.py`), so a
failing check reports the same boundary that export would reject.

Section numbers below mirror the owning section of
`shared-standards-core.md` (`§1.x`, `§2.x`) so cross-references resolve in
either direction.

## §1 Inline properties and text grammar

**Registered inline `style` properties** (names only; values follow the
element contract):

| Property family | Allowed inline `style` properties |
|---|---|
| Paint and line | `fill`, `stroke`, `stroke-width`, `stroke-dasharray`, `stroke-linecap`, `stroke-linejoin`, `fill-opacity`, `stroke-opacity`, `vector-effect` |
| Text | `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, `text-anchor`, `letter-spacing`, `text-decoration` |
| Alpha and definition paint | `opacity`, `stop-color`, `stop-opacity`, `flood-color`, `flood-opacity` |
| Literal geometry | The element-specific properties in §2.1 |
| Preview-only | `shape-rendering`; it does not change native geometry |

Conditional properties with a required XML form stay out of inline style:
`filter="url(#id)"`, `clip-path="url(#id)"`, `marker-start` / `marker-end`,
and `baseline-shift="super|sub"` on `<tspan>` are direct attributes.
`!important`, unknown CSS properties, blend modes, isolation, and backdrop
filters fail quality check.

**Text value grammar**: ordinary generated text uses a non-empty
`font-family`, a finite positive unitless-px `font-size`, `font-weight` of
`normal` / `bold` / an integer hundred from `100` through `900`, `font-style`
of `normal` / `italic`, and `text-anchor` of `start` / `middle` / `end`.
Inheritable text declarations belong only on `<svg>`, `<g>`, `<text>`, or
`<tspan>`; `text-anchor` is invalid on `<tspan>`. Unknown or unmapped
declarations fail checker preflight and native export. Tracking,
underline/strike, text outline/alpha, gradient text, and text filter effects
follow `svg-effects.md` §6.7.

**Compact inherited authoring**: `--canonical-authoring` reports drift from
the compact form (common typography on `<svg>`, shared paint on the nearest
meaningful `<g>`, explicit child overrides) as an advisory warning;
`compact_svg_styles.py --inplace` applies the same normalization on request to
authored project pages, never to structured template rosters.

DrawingML has no arbitrary per-pixel alpha-compositing path. A registered
single-image text picture/texture fill follows `svg-effects.md` §6.3;
arbitrary text-knockout composites, multi-layer image text, and arbitrary
alpha composites remain bake-required before SVG export.

---

## §1.1 Line-end markers

`marker-start` and `marker-end` are supported on `<line>` and `<path>` only
when the referenced marker fits this native-arrow contract:

| Concern | Required form |
|---|---|
| Reference | Exact local `url(#id)` to a `<marker>` in `<defs>` |
| Orientation | `orient="auto"` or `orient="auto-start-reverse"`; the latter reverses `marker-start` while behaving like `auto` at `marker-end` |
| Shape | One direct shape representing a DrawingML `triangle`, `stealth`, `arrow`, `diamond`, or `oval` line end: a 3-vertex `<polygon>` / closed path (triangle), a simple concave 4-vertex `<polygon>` / closed path (stealth), an open 3-vertex path (arrow), a simple convex 4-vertex `<polygon>` / closed path (diamond), or one `<circle>` / `<ellipse>` (oval) |
| Path grammar | One explicit `M`/`L` command per vertex. Triangle, stealth, and diamond paths end in `Z`; arrow paths remain open after the third vertex. No `H`, `V`, curves, or implicit multi-point `L` inside a marker path |
| Color parity | Triangle, stealth, diamond, and oval use a fill matching the parent line stroke. The open arrow uses `fill="none"` and a stroke matching the parent line stroke. DrawingML line ends inherit the line color |

The converter maps these five shapes to their corresponding DrawingML line-end
types. Prefer `<polygon>` for the closed triangle, stealth, and diamond forms;
the open arrow form requires `<path>`. Four-vertex shapes must be simple and
non-degenerate: convex geometry maps to diamond and concave geometry maps to
stealth. Other marker shapes have no native mapping and block export instead
of being silently dropped. Marker type is `Native-normalized`; size is
`Approximate` (`sm` / `med` / `lg`).

PPTX import compatibility, tolerant recovery, strict-mode rejection, and
diagnostic behavior are indexed in
[`conversion.md`](conversion.md#import-compatibility-and-recovery-boundary).

---

## §1.2 Image clipping

`clip-path` maps natively only on SVG `<image>` (including an exact crop
wrapper's inner image). Legacy imported crops may retain an outer-wrapper clip
as compatible input.

| Concern | Required form |
|---|---|
| SVG-namespace `<clipPath>` defined inside `<defs>` | Converter looks up one exact local id; missing, duplicate, foreign-namespace, or malformed references fail |
| Contains exactly one direct SVG-namespace supported shape child | Multiple shapes are not composited |
| Shape is one of: `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<rect>` (optional rx/ry), `<path>`, `<polygon>` | These map to DrawingML geometry (preset or custom) |
| No `clip-rule` or `fill-rule`, whether direct or in inline `style` | DrawingML picture geometry has no equivalent winding-rule control |
| Used only on `<image>` or a compatible legacy imported crop wrapper | Shapes, groups, text, and generalized nested SVG targets are forbidden |

| SVG clip shape | DrawingML output |
|---|---|
| `<circle>` / `<ellipse>` | Full-frame `<a:prstGeom prst="ellipse"/>`; the child must exactly cover the image frame. A `userSpaceOnUse` circle requires a square physical frame; a normalized `objectBoundingBox` circle may fill any frame |
| `<rect>` / `<rect rx="..."/>` | A plain full-frame rect is a compatible no-op; rounded form maps to full-frame `<a:prstGeom prst="roundRect"/>` with one physical radius adjustment. The rect must exactly cover the image frame and cannot express non-uniform physical corner radii |
| `<path>` / `<polygon>` | `<a:custGeom>` with coordinates mapped into the image frame |

A contour that depends on even-odd or another explicit winding rule is outside
this mapping and must be rebuilt as one unambiguous visible contour or
pre-rendered.

---

## §1.3 Static same-document `<use>`

Static local reuse is compile-time authoring shorthand. `finalize_svg.py` and
native export replace each qualifying instance with cloned primitive content;
PPTX-to-SVG import emits the resulting primitives and does **not** reconstruct
the original `<use>` / `<symbol>` structure.

| Concern | Required form |
|---|---|
| Reference syntax | SVG 2 form `href="#id"`. Legacy `xlink:href="#id"` remains read-compatible and Live Preview normalizes it to `href`; if both attributes exist, their values MUST match |
| Referenced target | One of `<symbol>`, `<g>`, `<use>`, `<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<line>`, `<path>`, `<polygon>`, `<polyline>`, `<text>`, or `<image>`. Nested local `<use>` is recursively expanded |
| Instance position | Generated `<use x>` / `<use y>` use finite unitless values; an explicit `px` suffix is read-compatible. Omitted values default to `0` |
| Symbol viewport | A referenced `<symbol>` MUST have a finite four-number `viewBox` with positive width/height. Its `<use>` MUST have positive finite unitless `width` and `height`; an explicit `px` suffix is read-compatible |
| Aspect ratio | Default/aligned `meet` values and plain `preserveAspectRatio="none"` are supported. `slice`, `refX`, and `refY` are forbidden |
| Viewport boundary | Symbol artwork MUST stay inside its `viewBox`; expansion does not reproduce symbol overflow clipping |
| Internal references | Author exact `href="#id"` and `url(#id)` fragments. The expander also reads legacy `xlink:href="#id"` and rewrites all instance-local cloned IDs |
| Structural metadata | Neither the `<use>` instance nor its referenced subtree may carry `data-pptx-layer*`, chart/table replacement metadata (`data-pptx-replace-with`, `data-pptx-replacement-*`, `data-pptx-import-source`, or `data-pptx-fallback-*`), or `data-pptx-placeholder*`. Author those objects directly instead |
| Safety limits | A reachable reference chain may contain at most 64 instances, and one SVG may expand at most 10,000 local `<use>` instances |

**Forbidden — unsafe local references**: external/file/data URLs, missing
targets, conflicting `href` / `xlink:href`, unsupported target elements,
circular reference chains; duplicate IDs on the referenced target, the `<use>`
instance, or anywhere in the reused subtree; quoted/whitespace CSS fragment
variants such as `url('#id')`.

---

## §1.4 Imported native PowerPoint shapes

`pptx_to_svg.py` emits rendering-neutral metadata when a visible SVG object
originates from `p:sp`, `p:cxnSp`, or `p:grpSp`. This contract is for lossless
import SVGs and unchanged imported objects that remain Slide-local or inside a
slot during mirror materialization. Ordinary authored SVG does not need these
attributes, and no separate source-payload opt-in marker exists.

| Metadata | Placement | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `data-pptx-object` | Logical `<g>` and native carrier | `shape`, `connector`, `group`, or `picture`; never infer the object kind from path appearance. |
| `data-pptx-shape-id` + `data-pptx-shape-scope` | Logical `<g>` and carrier | Preserve the source part-scoped identity. Export remaps duplicate Master/Layout/Slide ids into page-unique ids before rebinding connector references. |
| `data-pptx-frame="x y width height"` | Logical `<g>` and carrier | Own native `a:xfrm` position and size. Lossless import SVGs and tool-side native records use sufficient precision for exact EMU recovery; the model-facing authoring IR may use the compact page-coordinate spelling defined below. Path bounds, stroke, markers, shadows, and text glyph bounds never replace this frame. |
| `data-pptx-prst` | Preset carrier and logical `<g>` | One of the locked 187 DrawingML `ST_ShapeType` values. |
| `data-pptx-av-*` | Preset carrier and logical `<g>` | Preserve the complete validated DrawingML adjustment formula, including non-`val` formulas. |
| `data-pptx-part="geometry"` | One hidden carrier path | The single native export authority for frame, base fill/line/effect, preset/custom geometry, and object identity. |
| `data-pptx-part="geometry-preview"` / `geometry-detail` | Visible preview group/paths | Render the preset's independent path fill/stroke layers. A hash-locked preview group may mirror the carrier's one filter so a multi-path preset renders one aggregate imported effect; these elements are never emitted as duplicate PowerPoint shapes. |
| `data-pptx-preview-sha256` | Logical preset `<g>` and carrier | Detect edits to visible preset paths or paint. A stale preview fails quality check/export instead of silently reusing old native metadata. |
| `data-pptx-geometry-kind="custom"` + `data-pptx-custgeom` or `data-pptx-custgeom-ref` | Custom-geometry carrier | Preserve the validated original `a:custGeom` subtree. If the visible path hash is unchanged, export writes formulas, handles, connection sites, text rectangle, and path list exactly; edited paths compile from current SVG geometry. |
| `data-pptx-start/end-shape-id/site` | Connector logical `<g>` and carrier | Restore `a:stCxn` / `a:endCxn` after scoped shape-id allocation. A connector may retain one zero frame axis; it must not be expanded from visible stroke or marker bounds. |
| `data-pptx-shape-style` or `data-pptx-shape-style-ref` | Native carrier | Preserve a relationship-free `p:style` independently of text, including shapes with no visible text. |
| `data-pptx-effect-status="unsupported"` + `data-pptx-effect-reason` | Imported `p:sp` / `p:cxnSp` logical object and native carrier; imported `p:pic` carrier and logical object; imported `p:grpSp` logical group; imported table `p:graphicFrame` logical group | Record why an encountered source object or text-run `effectLst` / `effectDag` cannot enter the registered target-specific effect mapping without changing semantics. Checker and export stop with the recorded reason; these attributes are diagnostics, not a preserved effect payload or authoring syntax. |
| `metadata[data-pptx-part="txbody"]` with inline Base64 or `data-pptx-ref` | Logical shape `<g>` | Preserve unchanged `p:txBody`, including an empty text body. Content, whitespace, positioning, visible typography, or incompatible child-topology edits invalidate the payload. A source payload with run-level effects then blocks checker/export instead of losing those effects; an effect-free payload uses the normal SVG text fallback. |

**Compact native metadata transport**: Type A mirror materialization moves
`p:txBody`, relationship-free `p:style`, and `a:custGeom` payloads into the
content-addressed `templates/native_payloads.json.gz` store. It also
deduplicates repeated native restoration fields — object identity, frame,
preset/custom-geometry guards, preview/text hashes, connector endpoints,
payload references, and adjustment formulas — into short
`data-pptx-native-ref` records in the same store. Checker, template-structure
validation, and export validate and hydrate both layers in memory. Keep
Master/Layout, placeholder, layer, editable-object, diagnostic, and editable
chart/table metadata inline; authoritative Chart/Table JSON stays inside its
SVG marker, never in the payload store. Legacy inline Base64 and v1
payload-only stores remain readable.

One effect reason remains its existing plain token. If one imported object has
multiple independent unsupported reasons, both marker copies store the same
deduplicated, lexicographically sorted compact JSON string array in
`data-pptx-effect-reason`; adding a later reason must not overwrite an earlier
one. This array is diagnostic metadata, not an authoring surface.

**Import/authoring representation split**:

| Representation | Contract |
|---|---|
| Lossless import SVG | Immutable native payload and preview evidence in the temporary analysis workspace; never editable template source. |
| Authoring IR bundle | Editable SVG plus model-readable `authoring_summary.json` and tool-only `authoring_manifest.json`. Keep visible intent and document-local `data-pptx-source-ref`, but omit opaque/duplicate carriers. Before hashing, compact safe imported frame/transform coordinates to two decimals. Summary indexes current files; manifest owns source paths/hashes and stays outside model context. |
| `standard` / `fidelity` output | Use §1.5 compact presets; never transplant opaque payload or source topology. |
| `mirror` output | Template_Designer reviews/authors the compact parsed IR; materialization validates refs/graph and publishes that tree without restoring visible lossless subtrees. Recover only supported non-visible semantics; expand fixed Master/Layout wrappers without changing ownership or intended presentation. |

**Model-facing page-coordinate precision** (the canonical checker reports
over-precision as an advisory warning):

| Surface | Precision contract |
|---|---|
| Imported `data-pptx-frame` in authoring IR | At most two decimals; the compact frame owns visible geometry. |
| `data-pptx-bounds` in generated and final template SVG | At most two decimals. |
| `translate(...)`, `rotate(... cx cy)`, and `matrix(... e f)` | Translation/center values use at most two decimals; keep angle and matrix `a b c d` unchanged. |
| Protected values | Never compact path/points geometry, crop/nested-`viewBox` ratios, gradient offsets, opacity, scale, canonical preset frames, or lossless/tool-side frames. |

**Authoring source refs**: `data-pptx-source-ref` is create-template IR-only
and unique per document. Tools resolve it through that document's
`authoring_manifest.json`; models never read the manifest. Extract/re-inline
preserves the ref and vector inventory mapping. Final templates and
`svg_output/` contain no source refs.

**Decoration extraction**: move text-free imported vectors to
`icons/imported/` and leave an inventoried `<use data-icon="imported/...">`.
The editor expands it; unchanged assets restore source objects and edited ones
become page-local vector units.

**Imported source proxy fallback**: only unsupported, text-free, schema-free,
unmarked ornament may use an atomic
`<image data-pptx-source-proxy="native-restore">` preview under
`images/source-object-previews/`. Meaning-bearing content stays readable inline
or reports a conversion gap. Unchanged proxies restore; removing a Slide-local
proxy deletes it, while inherited proxies remain. Proxy edits fail export.
Extraction/proxies are import-time only, never free-authored `svg_output/`.

**Structural-layer boundary**: An unchanged imported logical object may keep
currently supported metadata while it remains Slide-local or inside a slot. An
imported logical `<g>` cannot be assigned to Master/Layout because those layers
require direct semantic atoms. Mechanically expand a fixed-layer source group
into direct atoms, rebuilding a preset when supported and otherwise retaining
the visible SVG fallback. A newly authored compact preset `<g>` from §1.5 is
the sole group exception: validation proves that it compiles to exactly one
native shape/connector. Do not use this normalization to change ownership or
appearance.

**Selective payload**: Keep the lossless import SVG as immutable evidence; do
not copy every metadata block into a template. Mirror publishes the compact
authored subtree and recovers only converter-supported non-visible metadata,
never ordinary visible source XML. Unsupported/edited objects use the SVG
fallback. `data-pptx-replace-with` remains reserved for optional native
Chart/Table replacement.

**Registry and rendering rules**:

- The hash-locked shared registry must equal the independent 187-value shape
  catalog. Missing, duplicate, unknown, or corrupt definitions fail closed.
- Preset preview paths come from the shared DrawingML formula evaluator; do not
  add per-shape Python geometry handlers.
- Preset size is controlled only by `data-pptx-frame` / `a:xfrm`. Adjustment
  formulas control the contour inside that frame and are not rescaled when the
  frame changes.
- A group transform may move, scale, rotate, or flip the complete logical
  shape without invalidating its preview fingerprint. Editing a generated
  `geometry-detail` path directly is unsupported unless the carrier metadata
  and preview fingerprint are regenerated together.
- Unknown or malformed SVG transform operations fail closed. DrawingML cannot
  represent arbitrary shear, so a non-orthogonal transform must stop native
  export instead of being silently approximated as rotation and scale.
- Opaque XML payloads containing any `r:*` relationship attribute are never
  copied into a new slide part. Relationship-bearing text content and
  shape-level `a:blipFill` use the existing rebuilt visual fallback and are
  not covered by atomic `p:sp + p:txBody` rehydration.
- Unknown future presets and explicit `unsupported` geometry status never
  downgrade silently to `rect`; native export stops with the recorded reason.

**Fidelity boundary**: native preset/custom geometry, logical frame, scoped
identity, connector topology, and relationship-free unchanged horizontal
text-body semantics on ordinary shape fills are `Native-stable`. The SVG
preview paint for gradient/pattern `darken`/`lighten` layers is
`Native-normalized`; original group child coordinates, shape-level image-fill
reconstruction, and vertical-text reconstruction are also normalized rather
than byte-identical OOXML.

## §1.5 Authored native PowerPoint presets — machine contract

Selection behavior lives in
[`native-shape-authoring.md`](../../references/native-shape-authoring.md);
this section owns the machine contract of the compact canonical fragment that
`preset_shape_svg.py` prints.

| Metadata / structure | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| `data-pptx-authoring="preset"` | Appears once on the logical `<g>`; distinguishes strict project authoring from legacy/imported metadata. |
| `data-pptx-object` | `shape` or `connector`; connector-family presets must use `connector`, and `connector` must use a connector-family preset. Authored connectors require `fill="none"` plus a visible stroke and export as unconnected `p:cxnSp`. |
| `data-pptx-prst`, `data-pptx-frame`, `data-pptx-av-*` | Generated together from the locked registry and written once on the logical group. The frame is the helper's exact four-part, space-separated ordinary-decimal spelling and remains authoritative even when visible path bounds differ; commas, scientific notation, leading `+`, and redundant decimal spellings are rejected. |
| Local `fill` / `stroke` plus supported paint attributes | Base paint is written once on the group; a visible stroke also carries an explicit width. Canonical page/template authoring keeps channel paint local. Compatible ancestor paint/opacity may compose under the general SVG rules and receives a recommendation warning. |
| Optional direct `filter="url(#id)"` | Shape presets only: the helper writes one exact local reference to a direct `svg-effects.md` §6.4 filter definition. It compiles once on the complete native shape; connector presets, inline style, ordinary group filters, and child-path filters remain unsupported. |
| Ordered direct `<path>` children | Browser-visible registry layers only. Each child writes just its required path-level fill/stroke override; labels and decorations stay outside the atomic group. |
| No carrier / wrapper / fingerprint | `data-pptx-part`, hidden geometry carriers, preview wrappers, and `data-pptx-preview-sha256` belong to expanded import/compatibility transport, not canonical project authoring. |

Template ownership metadata is orthogonal to preset geometry. After inserting
the complete helper output, `create-template` may add only the registered
`data-pptx-layer`, `data-pptx-editable`, `data-pptx-carrier`, or
`data-pptx-role` attribute needed by the surrounding structured contract. It
must not change preset/frame/adjustment/paint metadata, the filter reference,
or any direct path.

**Reusable-template boundary**: a project-owned canonical template may retain
one complete helper-generated atomic fragment when the stock preset is an exact
semantic match and both its paint and optional effect stay inside the authoring
boundary. The fragment is an executable exemplar and one semantic atom, not a
freely editable template primitive. It may be Slide-local, the one carrier of
an `object` slot, or a direct Master/Layout fixed atom. An adaptation may reuse
it unchanged only when preset, frame, adjustments, paint, and the optional
filter reference are unchanged; otherwise regenerate the whole fragment with
the helper. Imported, mirror, and third-party templates are never upgraded by
contour inference.

**Authoring paint/effect boundary**: v1 accepts `none` or six-digit solid HEX
fill and stroke, optional fill/stroke opacity, stroke width, line cap, line
join, and one shape-only local filter id under `svg-effects.md` §6.4. Use
ordinary SVG for gradients, patterns, or other treatments outside this narrow
contract. Registry-derived multi-path darken/lighten colors and other
contextual derivatives need no separate lock row unless they become a
recurring named role. Mirror preserves source paint under §1.4 instead.

**Validation**: quality check and export both rerender authored fragments from
`preset + frame + adjustments + group paint` and compare every visible path and
path-level paint override directly. They separately validate the optional
effect reference through `svg-effects.md` §6.4. Registry-path edits, geometry
metadata that leaves those paths stale, unknown adjustments, invalid or
unresolved filter references, out-of-range frames/transforms, zero-scale
transforms, and shear/skew fail closed. Export expands the validated compact
group only in memory and reuses the lossless native-shape conversion path.
Older authored carrier/preview fragments remain compatible as ordinary
Slide-local input and receive a non-blocking migration warning; they do not
gain the new compact group's structured-atom exception. `pptx_to_svg` expanded
output remains the lossless round-trip form and is not warned as authored
input.

**Fidelity boundary**: an unchanged authored fragment is `Native-stable` as
one `p:sp` or `p:cxnSp`. Text remains outside the atomic fragment and may
export as a grouped editable text box. Authoring v1 creates only unconnected
`p:cxnSp`; it does not accept hand-written endpoint/site metadata. An
`actionButton*` preset maps visual geometry only. Preset appearance never
invents connector attachment, action behavior, navigation targets, or
hyperlinks; link behavior is authored under
[`native-hyperlinks.md`](../../references/native-hyperlinks.md).

---

## §2.1 Literal geometry lengths and inline geometry

**Direct geometry length grammar**: generated SVG writes the following XML
geometry values and `stroke-width` as finite unitless ordinary decimals in the
page `viewBox` coordinate space. The explicit `px` suffix is read-compatible
and receives a recommendation warning. No other unit is registered for this
surface.

| Element / surface | Direct length attributes |
|---|---|
| `<svg>`, `<rect>`, `<image>`, `<use>` | `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`; `<rect>` also `rx`, `ry` |
| `<circle>` | `cx`, `cy`, `r` |
| `<ellipse>` | `cx`, `cy`, `rx`, `ry` |
| `<line>` | `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` |
| `<text>` / positional `<tspan>` | `x`, `y`; `<tspan>` also `dx`, `dy` |
| Any supported painted element | `stroke-width` |

`width`, `height`, `r`, `rx`, `ry`, and `stroke-width` must be non-negative;
the stricter positive `<use>` symbol-viewport rule remains in §1.3. `pt`,
`pc` / `pica`, `in`, `cm`, `mm`, `q`, `em`, `rem`, percentages, unknown units,
non-finite values, expressions, scientific notation, leading plus signs, and
trailing decimal points are invalid here even when generic SVG/CSS defines
them. A missing attribute may use its documented SVG/project default; an
explicitly supplied invalid value never falls back to that default.

**Inline geometry in `style`**: the following properties may appear in the
same element's `style="..."`. The pipeline materializes them as XML geometry
attributes before SVG post-processing and native PPTX conversion; an inline
declaration overrides an existing same-name XML attribute.

| Element | Recognized properties |
|---|---|
| `<rect>` | `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `rx`, `ry` |
| `<circle>` | `cx`, `cy`, `r` |
| `<ellipse>` | `cx`, `cy`, `rx`, `ry` |
| `<image>` | `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` |
| `<svg>` | `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` |
| `<use>` | `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` |

Every non-zero inline geometry value is one finite `px` literal, such as
`120px` or `-8.5px`; exact zero may be unitless. `width`, `height`, `rx`,
`ry`, and `r` must be non-negative. Percentages, `auto`, `calc()`, `var()`,
`!important`, `inherit`, and every other unit are forbidden. Line endpoints,
text positions, path data, and polygon/polyline points remain XML attributes.

`<style>`, `class`, selector rules, external stylesheets, and imported styles
remain forbidden. This contract is only for literal declarations in an
element's own `style` attribute; PPT Master does not compute CSS cascade or
custom properties. Root canvas authority remains the `viewBox`, regardless of
root `<svg>` compatibility width/height values. The shared coordinate and
geometry implementation is
[`utils.py`](../svg_to_pptx/drawingml/utils.py).

---

## §2.2 Group opacity

DrawingML has no isolated group-alpha model. The converter accepts
`<g opacity="...">` and inline group `opacity` by multiplying group alpha into
descendants. That path is `Approximate`; nested group/child alpha multiplies,
and `--native-charts-and-tables` rejects transparent native table/chart
markers. The quality checker reports a non-blocking fidelity warning so
existing or intentionally authored input can continue without modification.
New `svg_output/` puts alpha on the affected descendant paint, text run,
picture, or supported effect instead.

---

## §4 Canvas and packaging boundaries

**Canvas authority**: `viewBox="0 0 W H"` with positive integer pixels.
Numerically equivalent spellings and positive fractional imported dimensions
remain compatible; export quantizes once at `1 SVG px = 9,525 EMU`.
Invalid/non-finite values, non-zero origin, non-positive size, or unsupported
PowerPoint dimensions are errors. Optional root `width`/`height` do not
override `viewBox`. Root `<svg>` transform is forbidden; nested crop and
`<symbol viewBox>` keep their own contracts.

**Native PowerPoint background promotion**: outside structured mode, the first
eligible visual layer may be a direct full-canvas `<rect>` or one inside a
simple single-child group. Its fill must have a registered native mapping
(solid, linear/radial gradient, or preset pattern), and it must have no
transform, filter, clip, rounding, or visible stroke. Export writes the fill as
Slide `p:bg`; image elements remain pictures. Structured routes use the
narrower explicit solid-background ownership contract in
[`pptx-structure-interface.md`](../../references/pptx-structure-interface.md).

**Flat packaging**: `pptx_structure.mode: flat` keeps represented objects
Slide-local; export emits one clean Master plus Blank Layout, removes stock
content placeholders/Layout inventory, and retains the standard
date/footer/slide-number hooks. Without a Layout/Deck owner, Quick uses the
same ownership with converter-default theme scaffolding. Reusable Layouts are
mapped through `page_layouts` / `page_pptx_layouts` in Default and inferred
from the complete structured SVG roster in Quick; ownership is never inferred
from repeated Slide-local geometry.

**Root-group bounds checks**: every visible direct root `<g>` except a compact
helper-authored preset atom declares root-coordinate
`data-pptx-bounds="x y width height"`. The checker fails ordinary root-group
overlap exceeding `1px` on both axes (structured slots, structural-role groups,
and off-canvas Morph staging groups are exempt; structured Slide-local groups
are not). It compares each subcanvas with the root `viewBox`, and estimable
descendant text — including both multiline `<tspan>` forms — with the
subcanvas using the shared per-run width estimate, inline-formula height
envelope, and DrawingML wrapping headroom; it separately compares estimable
visible text with the root `viewBox` before that headroom. Per side, overflow
through `1px` is ignored; module-boundary overflow warns through `5%` and
fails above `5%`, while any larger root-`viewBox` text overflow fails. Bounds
do not clip or reflow; unestimable visible text receives an advisory warning.
Only a wholly off-canvas direct-root Morph endpoint may set
`data-pptx-morph-staging="true"`; its own module bounds still apply, retained
Morph uses an explicit pair, and the marker never excuses partial page
overflow. Primitive fallback (a root with no top-level `<g>` at all) is capped
at 8 visible primitives.

# Part II — Effects and Geometry Grammar (`svg-effects.md` §6)

Section numbers mirror [`svg-effects.md`](../../references/svg-effects.md).
The shared converter implementation for §§6.2–6.8 is
[`utils.py`](../svg_to_pptx/drawingml/utils.py); paths use
[`paths.py`](../svg_to_pptx/drawingml/paths.py).

## §6.2 Color, alpha, and opacity

Compatible paint grammar includes recognized named colors, `rgb()` / `rgba()`,
`hsl()` / `hsla()`, and `#RGB` / `#RGBA` / `#RRGGBB` / `#RRGGBBAA`; the
converter also tolerates legacy bare 3/4/6/8-digit hexadecimal tokens. The
generated canonical form is uppercase six-digit `#RRGGBB`; the checker prints
an optional canonical rewrite as a recommendation warning that never blocks
export. Explicit empty, malformed, or unrecognized paint values are errors in
both checker and exporter preflight; neither converts unknown intent into
`noFill` or default black.

| Intent | Canonical authoring | Native result / fidelity |
|---|---|---|
| Solid fill or text paint | `fill="#RRGGBB"` | Solid DrawingML paint; `Native-stable` |
| Fill/text alpha | Opaque `fill` + `fill-opacity="0..1"` | Fill/run alpha; `Native-stable` |
| Stroke alpha | Opaque `stroke` + `stroke-opacity="0..1"` | Line/outline alpha; `Native-stable` |
| Gradient-stop alpha | Opaque `stop-color` + `stop-opacity="0..1"` | Per-stop alpha; `Native-stable` |
| Shadow/glow alpha | Opaque `flood-color` + `flood-opacity="0..1"` | Glow `Native-stable`; outer shadow visually calibrated `Approximate` |
| Picture fade | `<image opacity="0..1">` | Picture `<a:alphaModFix>`; `Native-stable` |
| One atomic whole-object fade | Non-group element `opacity="0..1"` | Alpha compiled into its supported paint/effect channels; `Native-normalized` |
| Pattern alpha | Opaque pattern child paint + child fill/stroke opacity | Conditional; `native-data-interface.md` |
| CSS color alpha | Alpha-bearing named/functional/HEX paint | `Native-normalized`; recommendation warning only |
| Group fade | `<g opacity>` compatibility | `Approximate`; fidelity warning; §2.2 |

```text
effective fill alpha
= color alpha × ancestor group opacity × element opacity × fill-opacity
```

`opacity`, `fill-opacity`, `stroke-opacity`, `stop-opacity`, and
`flood-opacity` are finite unitless numbers from `0` to `1`; the converter also
accepts finite numeric values that SVG/CSS clamps into that interval, and
`stop-opacity` / `flood-opacity` additionally accept finite percentages (the
checker reports those spellings as recommendation warnings). Malformed or
non-finite values are errors. `fill="transparent"` / `stroke="transparent"`
become no fill/line. PPTX import is a user-input boundary: tolerant mode
retains recognized color semantics, omits only unsupported paint properties,
and records the decision in `conversion-report.json`; `--strict` keeps the
closed parser checks.

## §6.3 Gradients and text picture fill

| Concern | Contract |
|---|---|
| Definition | Direct `<linearGradient>` / `<radialGradient>` child of `<defs>` with unique `id` |
| Reference | Exact local `url(#id)` |
| Stops | ≥2 direct `<stop>` children; explicit color; finite non-decreasing offset in `0..1` or `0%..100%` (ties form hard edges); optional alpha |
| Coordinates | `objectBoundingBox` only. Generated values `0..1`; omitted linear axis = `(0,0) → (1,0)`. Only import-normalized linear projections may reach `-0.105..1.105`; radial values stay in `0..1`, and the effective focus must lie inside the circle centered at `(0.5,0.5)` with radius `0.5` |
| Forbidden | External/quoted refs, `href` inheritance, `gradientTransform`, `spreadMethod`, CSS gradients |

| Target | Contract and fidelity |
|---|---|
| `<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<path>`, `<polygon>` fill/stroke | Linear `Native-normalized`; radial `Approximate` |
| `<line>` / `<polyline>` | Gradient stroke only; linear `Native-normalized`, radial `Approximate` |
| `<text>` / non-positional `<tspan>` | Gradient fill only; no gradient text outline |
| `<image>` | No gradient paint; use §6.5 overlays |

Linear export preserves stops/alpha and reduces direction to an angle;
coincident endpoints are invalid. Radial export preserves the effective focus
(`fx/fy`, otherwise `cx/cy`) as a point-focused circle; its outer center and
radius normalize to `0.5`, so distinct outer `cx/cy` and `r` are dropped. A
focus outside that canonical circle is invalid because SVG renderers clamp it
to the circumference while DrawingML retains the rectangle coordinates; reverse
import centers such a focus and records a diagnostic. Gradient strokes stay
editable; reverse import may keep the first stop only. Stop alpha multiplies
element opacity. An `objectBoundingBox` gradient stroke requires non-zero
intrinsic width and height (a perfectly horizontal or vertical gradient ribbon
disappears); checker and exporter reject the degenerate form.

**Native text picture/texture fill**:

| Concern | Contract |
|---|---|
| Target | Direct `fill="url(#id)"` on `<text>` or a non-positional `<tspan>`; the text remains editable |
| Definition | Direct `<pattern>` child of `<defs>` with unique `id` and exact `data-pptx-text-image-fill="stretch"` or `"tile"` |
| Image | Exactly one direct SVG-namespace `<image>` child; project-local or data-URI source; explicit positive `width` / `height` |
| Native result | `stretch` → run-level `a:blipFill/a:stretch`; `tile` → run-level `a:blipFill/a:tile` |
| Alpha | Text `fill-opacity` multiplies the native picture-fill alpha |
| Forbidden | Preset-pattern attributes; `patternTransform`; additional pattern children; image style/alpha/clip/filter/mask/transform; use outside text; unannotated custom image patterns; multi-image/layer knockout composites |

`stretch` is `Native-normalized`; `tile` may normalize tile scale or phase and
needs visual review. Forward SVG→PPTX export is native; PPTX→SVG does not
reconstruct run-level picture fills yet. Preset patterns are a separate
interface in `native-data-interface.md`.

## §6.4 Shadows and glow

Filters are native-effect metadata, not a general pixel-filter surface.

| Concern | Contract |
|---|---|
| Definition/reference | Direct `<defs><filter id="...">` child with unique id; direct `filter="url(#id)"` attribute, never inline style |
| Public targets | `<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<polygon>`, `<image>`, `<path>`, `<text>`; one validated compact authored shape-preset `<g>`; an exact outer `<g filter>` whose sole visual child is one clipped `<image>` |
| Required primitive | `feDropShadow` or `feGaussianBlur` |
| Generated glow form | Zero-offset `feDropShadow` with flood paint, or the complete blur + flood + composite + merge graph; never bare blur |
| Required parameters | Explicit `stdDeviation` on either effect primitive; explicit `dx`, `dy`, and `flood-opacity` on `feDropShadow`; explicit `flood-opacity` on `feFlood`; explicit `slope` on linear `feFuncA` |
| Accepted helpers | `feOffset`, `feFlood`, `feComposite`, `feMerge`, `feMergeNode`, `feComponentTransfer`, linear `feFuncA` |
| Alpha transfer | Linear `feFuncA` maps multiplicative `slope` only; `intercept` is unsupported |
| Blur sampling | `feGaussianBlur edgeMode` is unsupported |
| Primitive coordinates | Omit `primitiveUnits` or use `userSpaceOnUse`; `objectBoundingBox` coordinates are unsupported |
| Numeric values | Finite unitless values; non-negative `stdDeviation`; finite `dx` / `dy`; `feFuncA slope` within `0..1`; mapped glow `rad = stdDeviation × 9525`, shadow `blurRad = stdDeviation × 2 × 9525`, and shadow `dist = hypot(dx,dy) × 9525` must round into DrawingML `0..27273042316900` |
| Classification | Meaningful non-zero offset → one outer shadow; zero/no offset → one glow |
| Fidelity | `Approximate`; one filter becomes one DrawingML effect |

Flood opacity, linear `feFuncA slope`, and element opacity multiply; the
converter-only historical path may also multiply flood-color alpha and
ancestor group opacity. Native export does not preserve filter-region,
`in/in2/result`, merge order, or composite topology. Other primitives,
multiple independent effects, and filters on `<tspan>` / ordinary `<g>` /
unsupported targets are forbidden. Special `<g filter>` targets are limited to
the helper-authored compact shape preset, the exact single clipped-image form,
the hash-locked `data-pptx-part="geometry-preview"` transport of an imported
preset, and the exact imported picture-crop carrier. Bare `feGaussianBlur`
remains compatible input but is never generated: preview blurs the object
while export emits glow. PPTX import maps one classifiable
shape/connector/picture outer shadow or glow to this contract; unsupported
effects and outer-shadow variants whose scale, skew, alignment, or rotation
semantics cannot be retained become import diagnostics. Checker and exporter
preflight enforce the same definition, reference, primitive, target, and
numeric-value contract; missing required geometry is never replaced by effect
defaults.

## §6.5 Image carriers and crop transport

| Need | Authoring contract | Fidelity |
|---|---|---|
| Cover/crop | Readable raster dimensions + aligned `slice` | Native `srcRect`; `Native-stable`; otherwise native crop cannot be guaranteed |
| Contain/fit | Aligned `meet` | Fitted picture frame; `Native-normalized` |
| Stretch | `preserveAspectRatio="none"` | Native stretched frame |
| Uniform fade | `<image opacity="...">` | Native picture alpha |
| Shaped picture | §1.2 image-only `clip-path` | Preset/custom picture geometry |

**Closed aspect-ratio grammar**: on `<image>`, omit `preserveAspectRatio` for
the default `xMidYMid meet`, use `none` alone for stretch, or use one of the
nine case-sensitive alignments (`xMinYMin`, `xMidYMin`, `xMaxYMin`,
`xMinYMid`, `xMidYMid`, `xMaxYMid`, `xMinYMax`, `xMidYMax`, `xMaxYMax`)
followed by explicit `meet` or `slice`. An alignment without a mode and values
needing whitespace normalization are compatible input with a recommendation.
Empty values, `defer`, unknown/wrong-case alignments or modes, `none` with a
mode, and extra tokens are errors.

**Fit/clip interaction**: a non-trivial clip disables `meet` frame-fit; match
the image box to the source ratio or use `slice`. Put one §6.4 filter directly
on an unclipped `<image>`; for a clipped picture keep `clip-path` on the
`<image>` and put the filter on an exact outer `<g>` whose sole visual child is
that image. Never combine `filter` and `clip-path` on the same `<image>`. The
carrier may keep object-local id, role, transform, and `data-pptx-carrier`; it
may own `data-pptx-layer="master|layout"` only when the carrier itself is the
direct fixed atom, and never `data-pptx-placeholder`, `data-pptx-binding`, or
chart/table replacement metadata.

**Decodable sources**: every `<image>` has explicit positive `width`/`height`
and exactly one non-empty `href` or compatible `xlink:href`. A data URI must use
a supported `image/*` MIME type, valid strict base64 when marked `base64`, a
non-empty payload, and bytes that decode as the declared format. An external
asset must resolve, use a supported extension, be non-empty, and decode as
that extension. Registered formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF,
WMF. Explicit template substitution tokens may remain unresolved only during
template checking. Missing, ambiguous, corrupt, mislabeled, or unsupported
sources are errors and are never packaged as zero-byte media.

**Nested SVG is picture-crop transport, not a general viewport**: every
non-root `<svg>` is the exact wrapper accepted by the shared crop parser:

| Part | Required form |
|---|---|
| Outer | Registered `x`, `y`, positive `width`/`height`; four ordinary-decimal unit coordinates in `viewBox`; `preserveAspectRatio="none"`; `overflow="hidden"` |
| Child | Exactly one direct empty `<image>` with one non-empty `href`/`xlink:href`, `x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" preserveAspectRatio="none"` |
| Context | Only root SVG / ordinary visual `<g>` ancestors; outer may add `id`, supported `transform`, registered layer/carrier metadata, and `data-pptx-frame`, `data-pptx-object`, `data-pptx-shape-id`, `data-pptx-shape-name`, `data-pptx-shape-scope`; an exact imported picture carrier may hold its one §6.4 filter outside this viewport |
| Shape crop | Exact outer `data-pptx-crop="1"`; authored wrappers put the registered, locally resolving image-only clip on the inner image, using `userSpaceOnUse` geometry matching the visible `viewBox`; legacy imported outer clips remain compatible |

The inner image may add only registered `opacity` and that clip. Quantize the
`viewBox` without clamping: every signed crop fits
`-2147483648..2147483647`, with `l + r < 100000` and `t + b < 100000`. Retain
negative/outside-source crops exactly; write redundant `0 0 1 1` as a plain
`<image>`. Extra, indirect, or character content; unknown attributes;
malformed or unrepresentable crops; and general nested viewports fail.

## §6.6 Lines, dashes, caps, joins, markers

| Surface | Contract / native result |
|---|---|
| Solid stroke/width/alpha | `Native-stable` editable line |
| `4,4`; `6,3`; `2,2`; `8,4`; `8,4,2,4` (comma or space separators) | `dash`; `dash`; `sysDot`; `lgDash`; `lgDashDot` (`Native-normalized`) |
| Canonical custom dash | Exactly two positive finite unitless ordinary decimals (`dash gap`); export scales/quantizes against stroke width; `Native-normalized` |
| Compatible custom dash | Three or more positive finite unitless values reduce to the first pair with a checker recommendation; compatible numeric spellings also warn |
| `stroke-linecap` | `butt`, `round`, `square`; `Native-stable` |
| `stroke-linejoin` | `miter`, `round`, `bevel`; `Native-stable` |
| `vector-effect` | Exactly `none` or `non-scaling-stroke`; export resolves the choice into native line width (`Native-normalized`) |
| `stroke-dashoffset` | No general line mapping; allowed only as a direct finite unitless ordinary-decimal attribute on a §6.10 thick-circle shorthand (`px` suffix warns) |
| Gradient stroke | §6.3; re-import may flatten to first stop |
| `marker-start` / `marker-end` | §1.1 native line end; type `Native-normalized`, size `Approximate` (`sm/med/lg`) |

The dash grammar is closed: exact lowercase `none`, or at least two finite
unitless numbers separated by whitespace or one comma. A leading plus sign,
exponent, trailing decimal point, surrounding whitespace, or longer custom list
is compatible input with a non-blocking normalization recommendation. Unknown
units, one-value arrays, empty or repeated comma fields, non-finite values,
and negative or zero entries are errors (the only zero exception is a gap on
the §6.10 thick-circle element). Cap, join, and `vector-effect` accept only the
exact lowercase tokens above; surrounding whitespace warns, every other token
is an error. PPTX import treats unsupported line properties as source
diagnostics: tolerant mode retains the object and omits only the unsupported
outline; `--strict` retains the closed rejection behavior.

## §6.7 Text property grammar

| Property | Canonical authoring | Compatible input | DrawingML mapping / rejection boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `font-weight` | `normal`, `bold`, or an exact integer hundred from `100` through `900` | `medium` → `500`; `semibold` → `600` | `normal` and `100..500` map to regular; `bold` and `600..900` map to `b="1"`; numeric weights are `Native-normalized` |
| `font-style` | `normal` or `italic` | None | `italic` maps to `i="1"`; oblique, angle, relative, and CSS-wide values are invalid |
| `text-anchor` | `start`, `middle`, or `end` on `<svg>`, `<g>`, or `<text>` | None | Maps to left/center/right paragraph alignment plus normalized frame position; invalid on `<tspan>` |
| `text-decoration` | `none`, `underline`, `line-through`, or `underline line-through` | `line-through underline` → canonical order | Maps to the single underline and strike run properties; unknown, repeated, or substring-like tokens are invalid |
| `baseline-shift` | Exact direct `super` or `sub` on `<tspan>` | None | Maps to editable `a:rPr@baseline` at `30000` or `-25000`; does not resize the run; invalid as inline style or on any other element; cannot combine with an inline formula marker |
| `letter-spacing` | Finite unitless ordinary decimal SVG px | The same decimal with `px`, `pt`, or `em`; normalized to unitless px | Maps to `a:rPr@spc`; the final value must fit DrawingML `-400000..400000`, and negative tracking must leave every generated run with a positive estimated advance and its text frame with a positive extent; keywords, percentages, exponents, leading plus signs, trailing decimal points, non-finite values, and other units are invalid |
| `font-size` | Finite unitless SVG px | `px`, `pt`, `pc`/`pica`, `in`, `cm`, `mm`, `q`, `em`, `rem` (recommendation warning) | Converted to SVG px, then editable DrawingML point size; unsupported units/percentages error |

Registered inheritable text properties follow SVG inheritance, including
declarations on the root `<svg>`: inline `style` overrides the same element's
direct attribute, which overrides its ancestor. `baseline-shift` is the narrow
exception: declare it directly on the owning `<tspan>`. Every declaration is
validated even when a later declaration overrides it.

**Negative tracking**: after run assembly, each output run must retain a
positive estimated advance using the quantized `sz` and `spc` values that will
be written; a wider sibling run or paragraph line cannot hide a run whose
aggregate advance would reverse or collapse. The generated text frame must
retain a positive horizontal and vertical extent. The checker rejects directly
measurable single-line violations, and the converter revalidates every run and
frame before writing OOXML without clamping or hiding a non-positive value.
Adjacent authored runs with identical final run properties form one output run
before sizing; splitting text across equivalent `<tspan>` nodes is not a
tracking escape hatch. Width estimates count the registered project text
clusters (combining marks, variation selectors, emoji modifiers and ZWJ
sequences, paired regional indicators, same-script virama conjuncts receive no
internal spacing). An unchanged imported native text body reuses the geometry
carrier's frame and attaches the preserved `txBody` payload.

**Element-specific text surface**:

- Inheritable text declarations belong only on `<svg>`, `<g>`, `<text>`, or `<tspan>`; placing them on geometry, image, definition, or reuse elements is an error.
- `<text>` accepts `x`, `y`, registered paint/alpha/run properties, the text properties above, `font-family`, `font-size`, direct `filter`, direct `transform`, `xml:space`, `id`, and project `data-*` metadata.
- `<tspan>` accepts `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, registered paint/alpha/run properties, `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, `letter-spacing`, `text-decoration`, direct `baseline-shift`, `xml:space`, `id`, and project `data-*` metadata. It does not accept `text-anchor`, `filter`, or `transform`.
- `word-spacing`, `dominant-baseline`, `alignment-baseline`, font shorthand/variant/stretch/feature/variation/synthesis controls, `font-kerning`/`kerning`, `font-size-adjust`, `line-height`, text alignment, indent/shadow/rendering controls, white-space/word-break/hyphenation controls, `writing-mode`, `vertical-align`, `direction`, `unicode-bidi`, `text-transform`, and any other unregistered `font-*` / `text-*` property are errors as direct attributes or inline style.

**Project text whitespace**: `xml:space` is valid only as an exact direct
attribute on `<text>` or `<tspan>`, accepts only `default` and `preserve`,
inherits through the text tree, and may be reset on a child `<tspan>`. The
project maps it to the visible Chromium/SVG2 behavior used by Live Preview:
XML line endings and tabs become U+0020; in `default` mode contiguous spaces
collapse across inline run boundaries and leading/trailing default-mode spaces
in the resulting chunk are removed; in `preserve` mode every U+0020 remains
significant. Only XML whitespace is normalized — NBSP, ideographic space, and
other Unicode spacing characters remain literal. Source line breaks do not
create PowerPoint paragraphs.

Bullet detection allows optional leading whitespace, requires non-empty
content, and leaves non-leading decorative glyphs as ordinary text; `·`/`•`
become `•`, the other registered leaders (`● ▪ ■ ◆ ◇ ◦ ‣`) stay unchanged, and
the marker run supplies color/alpha. Imported double underline/strike
normalizes to single. Text outline is solid only; shadow/glow applies to
`<text>` only and is `Approximate`.

## §6.8 Closed transform grammar

| Surface | Contract / fidelity |
|---|---|
| `rotate(angle[, cx, cy])` | Geometry/image/text/ordinary group; `Native-normalized` |
| `translate(x y)` | Geometry/image/group; pure translation also safe on text; `Native-normalized` |
| Positive scale / negative mirror | Geometry/image or a group/use whose expanded visual subtree is geometry/image only; explicit pivot; `Native-normalized` |
| `matrix(a b c d e f)` | Geometry/image or the same geometry/image-only group/use; transformed axes finite, non-zero, orthogonal; excludes rounded rectangles and subtrees containing them; `Native-normalized` |
| Source order | Back-to-front PPT z-order; `Native-stable` |
| `<g opacity>` | Compatible approximate mapping; §2.2 |
| Local `<use>` | §1.3 compile-time reuse; `Native-normalized` |

Use only lowercase `translate`, `scale`, `rotate`, and `matrix` with exact
finite unitless argument counts: `translate` 1/2, `scale` 1/2, `rotate` 1/3,
`matrix` 6. Separate arguments and operations with whitespace or one comma.
Leading/trailing/repeated commas, adjacent operations without a separator,
units, unknown functions, and incomplete input fail quality check and export.
A supported leading `+`, exponent, or trailing decimal point is compatible
input with a normalization warning. Model-facing translation values, rotation
centers, and matrix `e/f` use at most two decimals (§1.4); angles, scale
arguments, and matrix `a/b/c/d` retain the precision the transform requires.

A text transform is either a translate-only list or one rotate operation; a
group containing text follows the same limit. `skewX`, `skewY`, zero or
non-orthogonal axes, and shear matrices are forbidden. Native chart/table
markers allow translate/scale only. The §6.10 thick-circle shortcut does not
inherit general transform support. Positive rotation is clockwise and pivoted
rotation normalizes the native frame. Every cumulative matrix, including
transforms split across ancestors, must remain finite, non-zero, and
orthogonal; importer/live-editor matrices do not expand the hand-authored
contract. During mirror materialization, imported PowerPoint groups with an
axis flip keep their geometry reflection while each descendant SVG text node
receives the matching counter-reflection; the tool-side native record retains
the source group flip.

## §6.9 Freeform grammar and rounded rectangles

| Input | Native normalization | Fidelity |
|---|---|---|
| `M/L/H/V`, absolute or relative | Absolute `M/L` | `Native-normalized` |
| `C` | Cubic Bézier | `Native-normalized` |
| `S/Q/T` | Explicit cubic controls | `Native-normalized` |
| `A` | Cubic segments of at most 90° | `Approximate` |
| `Z`; polygon/polyline | Closed/open freeform | `Native-normalized` |

Generated `path@d` and `polygon` / `polyline@points` use finite unitless
ordinary decimals and only the commands above; each command accepts its
uppercase absolute and lowercase relative form. Native export consumes the
complete attribute and never extracts recognizable fragments while ignoring
other characters. Finite scientific notation, a leading plus sign, and a
trailing decimal point are read-compatible with recommendation warnings.
Unknown commands or characters, misplaced/repeated commas, non-finite numbers,
missing attributes, incomplete command groups, and odd point counts are
invalid. A path starts with `M` / `m`; `A` radii are non-negative and both arc
flags are exactly `0` or `1` (separator-free flag sequences parse as
individual tokens). A polygon has at least three coordinate pairs and a
polyline at least two. Command identity, relative coordinates, shorthand, arc
parameters, and original handles are not retained; geometry needs non-zero
bounds. Do not depend on `fill-rule="evenodd"`.

| Rounded rect input | Result |
|---|---|
| One positive radius, or `0 < rx == ry <= min(width,height)/2` | `Native-stable` adjustable `roundRect` without distorting transforms; the same short-side limit applies to one-radius input |
| `0 < abs(rx-ry) < 0.5px` after scaling | One normalized native radius; `Approximate` |
| `abs(rx-ry) >= 0.5px`, either positive | Cubic custom geometry; no radius handle; `Approximate` |
| Equal radius above half the short side | Native short-side clamp may differ from SVG; `Approximate` |

## §6.10 Thick-circle shorthand

`Approximate`, non-position-sensitive use only:

- One circle per segment; `fill="none"`; the circle may use one `rotate` for its start angle, and ancestor transforms must be translate-only.
- Exactly two non-preset finite unitless ordinary-decimal values (`dash gap`); `stroke-dashoffset` is a direct finite unitless ordinary-decimal attribute.
- `0 < stroke-width < 2r`, `stroke-width/r >= 0.15`, `0 < dash < 2πr`, `gap >= 0`, and `dash + gap >= 2πr - 1` SVG unit (the one-unit tolerance exists only for integer-rounded circumference values).
- Native construction uses only the first dash and re-imports as a freeform. Its native start is 90° counterclockwise from the SVG preview; use explicit arcs whenever start angle, cap, or radial precision matters.

Explicit arc sectors are editable `Approximate` freeforms; calculated endpoints
survive subject to EMU rounding, and `A` curves remain cubic approximations.
Thin circles using a §6.6 preset/two-number dash stay `Native-normalized`
ellipse lines.
