# Generate PPTX Route

> Load only after [`routing.md`](./routing.md) selects Default Generate or its Beautify profile. This file owns that runtime's Step 1–7 sequence, gates, role switching, and mandatory commands. Explicit Quick loads [`quick-generate.md`](./profiles/quick-generate.md) instead; Beautify enters here only when it does not explicitly select Quick.

**Hard rule — runtime paths**: expand every linked or abbreviated package path from the entry-time `SKILL_DIR` anchor inside each tool call; never change CWD or inherit a prior shell working directory.

**Default Core Pipeline**: `Initial Materials → [Fact Research] → Create Project → Template Candidate Preparation → Stage-1 Communication + Template Confirmation → [Template Installation] → Stage-2 Solution → [Image Acquisition] → Executor Live Preview → Quality Check → Post-processing → Export`

**Generate-specific execution discipline**:

- Page authoring stays with the current main agent ([`executor-base.md`](../references/executor-base.md) §3); the checker cadence is Step 6's.
- Gate checklists are internal: on success continue with at most one compact status line; on failure report only the blocking items and required recovery.

**SVG page-design boundary**: `svg_output/` is the complete page-design source — every visible element of the exported slide is in the page SVG or referenced by it; templates, `design_spec.md`, and `spec_lock.md` never supply content at export ([`shared-standards-core.md`](../references/shared-standards-core.md) §4.0). Export compiles only the selected route's explicit structure contract (`flat` Slide-local; `structured` Master/Layout/Slide parts) and never infers structure. `svg_final/` is an optional preview release export never reads. Notes, animations, narration, and Edit Native PPTX stay outside this closure.

## Cross-Cutting Authorities

| Concern | Authority |
|---|---|
| Step 1–7 order, gates, role switching, mandatory commands | This file |
| Fact channels, source/derived artifact boundaries, regeneration | [`artifact-ownership.md`](../references/artifact-ownership.md) |
| Stop/continue policy and resume pointers | [`failure-recovery.md`](./governance/failure-recovery.md) |
| Surface decision, in-run switch, Stage-1/Stage-2/result payload shapes | [`confirm-surface.md`](../references/confirm-surface.md); server lifecycle and template-selection sidecar in [`confirm_ui.md`](../scripts/docs/confirm_ui.md) |
| Validation and installation of confirmed template roots | [`apply-template-workspace.md`](./stages/apply-template-workspace.md); skipped for confirmed free design |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Source Content Processing

🚧 **GATE**: the user has provided a topic / desired outcome and any available initial material.

| User provides | Action |
|---|---|
| PDF / DOCX / Office document / XLSX / XLSM / PPTX / EPUB / HTML / LaTeX / RST / web URL | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md.py <file_or_URL_or_dir> [<file_or_URL_or_dir> ...]` |
| CSV / TSV | Read directly as a plain-text table source; a wide public dataset (World Bank, OECD, Eurostat) is first sliced to the needed rows and columns with a short Python snippet, never read whole |
| Markdown | Read directly |
| Topic only | Run [`topic-research`](stages/topic-research.md) first and use its research pair as source; Step 2 imports the pair without expanding the facts JSON's URLs |

The dispatcher writes standard Markdown plus a conversion profile beside each source. Use `-t <type>` only when detection is ambiguous and `-o` only when a specific output location is required (an output directory for multiple or directory inputs). PPTX sources also receive standard intake in `<project>/analysis/` after Step 2. Backend details: [`conversion.md`](../scripts/docs/conversion.md); its § Image Orientation Review applies when the user requests correction, converted text asks for rotated viewing, or a downloaded asset is visibly sideways (never launch its legacy HTML tool).

**Sufficiency test**: after reading direct and converted content, run [`topic-research`](stages/topic-research.md) only for gaps where the requested outcome would otherwise require inventing, omitting, or leaving unsupported an externally verifiable claim. A closed corpus stays within the supplied material; file presence or length is irrelevant. Research records facts and adopted URLs in its pair; Step 2 fetches no adopted page, and Step 5 acquires only Strategist-selected assets after final confirmation.

**EMF/WMF from DOCX/PPTX**: embedded Office vectors land in `images/` with `image_manifest.json` as first-class §VIII assets. Never convert them to PNG; export embeds them at full vector fidelity, and a blank browser preview is expected ([`project.md`](../scripts/docs/project.md); export behavior in [`svg-pipeline.md`](../scripts/docs/svg-pipeline.md)).

**✅ Checkpoint** — source content and any research pair are ready; proceed to Step 2.

---

### Step 2: Project Initialization

🚧 **GATE**: Step 1 complete; source content is ready (Markdown, direct text, or requirements described in conversation).

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py init <project_name>
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py import-sources <project_path> <source_files_or_dirs...>   # skip when content is only in conversation; another project's files are copied unless --move
```

**Hard rule — truthful canvas token**: append `--format <registered_format>` only when an explicit user/source fact already establishes an exact registered canvas ([`canvas-formats.md`](../references/canvas-formats.md)). Otherwise Stage 1 confirms the canvas, starting from the project-initialization canvas unless the user/source context changes it, and `spec_lock.md` records its viewBox.

**Workflow log**: initialization creates `<project_path>/validation/workflow.log`; later project-scoped Python tools record their command envelopes there automatically (prefix `PPT_MASTER_PROJECT_PATH="<project_path>"` when a helper's arguments do not identify the project). Append one concise note with `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/workflow_log.py <project_path> "<detail>"` only for a material handoff, rework reason, approved exception, or manual recovery with no owning command output. The log is cold audit evidence, never read during generation.

**Import rules**: pass the source path together with the Markdown Step 1 wrote beside it (a same-stem Markdown suppresses re-conversion and is imported with its sidecar and assets; the source alone is archived and converted again), both locations when `-o` wrote it elsewhere, and only the research pair when Topic Research ran (its facts JSON is imported as a file; no URL is fetched). Copy/move semantics, bitmap archiving, and the PPTX intake bundle it writes under `analysis/` (`<stem>.identity.json`, `<stem>.slide_library.json`, `source_profile.json`) are [`project.md`](../scripts/docs/project.md). Those artifacts are source facts and recommendation candidates, not replica constraints; Beautify stays single-deck.

**✅ Checkpoint** — project created, `sources/` complete, converted materials ready. `import-sources` exits 0 when any input converts: read the printed `skipped` reasons and treat those inputs as absent. Proceed to Step 3.

---

### Step 3: Template Candidate Preparation

Internal preparation for every Default run — no page, question, receipt, selection, template read, or installation. Quick skips this Step.

Candidates follow [`routing.md`](./routing.md) §7: registered roots from the four indexes plus every exact root supplied for this run. Raw PPTX is source material, not a candidate — raw PPTX plus new content is [`edit-native-pptx`](./edit-native-pptx.md), and a reusable workspace comes from [`create-template`](./create-template.md).

Resolve the surface under [`confirm-surface.md`](../references/confirm-surface.md).

| Branch | Preparation |
|---|---|
| UI | Run `--reset-template-selection`, then write `<project_path>/confirm_ui/template_options.json` with `schema_version: 1`, `phase: "template"`, the UI `lang`, all supplied roots as absolute `explicit_workspace_roots` (empty array when none), and `default_mode` — `templates` for explicit template intent or any supplied root, otherwise `free_design`. Do not launch yet; the server reads the indexes itself. |
| Chat / delegated | Retain the same candidate boundary in context and create no UI artifact. |

Stage 1 initializes from `default_mode` but the user may switch. Template mode requires at least one selection; exactly one supplied root may be preselected, several remain unselected.

**✅ Checkpoint** — candidates ready; nothing selected, read, validated, or installed. Proceed to Step 4 without a user-visible stop.

---

### Step 4: Strategist Phase (MANDATORY in the default pipeline)

🚧 **GATE**: Steps 1–3 complete; no template content in planning context; Stage 1 not started.

**Hard rule — Stage 1 is template-independent**: author every Stage-1 recommendation from the user's request, source facts, conversation constraints, and project-initialization state only; candidate paths, index summaries, template specs/prototypes/assets, and template canvas are not evidence. Template inspection begins only after Stage 1 confirms both the communication contract and the template/free-design choice and any selection is installed.

Load the planning core in one batch, plus the structured facts already in `<project_path>/analysis/`:

```
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/strategist.md
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/plan-core.md
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/canvas-formats.md
```

| Trigger | Additional Strategist reference |
|---|---|
| Stage 1 confirmed and a Brand/Style/Layout/Deck workspace installed | `references/strategist-template.md` before Stage 2 |
| Confirmed `delivery_context` is recorded/self-running/video, or input is a final/literal narration script | `references/video-design.md` before the three Stage-2 solutions and page roster |

After Stage 1 and the template handoff, load the fixed planning-capability block in one batch before authoring any Stage-2 solution, image recommendation, or roster:

```
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/strategist-image.md
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/modes/_index.md
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/visual-styles/_index.md
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/image-renderings/_index.md
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/icons/README.md
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/charts/chart-vocabulary.md
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/tables/table-vocabulary.md
```

This is a capability map, not a usage checklist; direction construction follows [`strategist.md`](../references/strategist.md) §d. Confirmed non-`none` image sources continue into resource planning under `strategist-image.md` (the image-layout files are Executor's); confirmed `none` writes no image rows but keeps the rendering candidates.

**Fact channels** ([`artifact-ownership.md`](../references/artifact-ownership.md) §1–2): before Stage 1 read `analysis/source_profile.json`'s `decks[]` digests, opening a deck's identity/slide-library files only when raw facts are needed. Content — text, tables, chart values, SmartArt wording — comes from the content-type files in `sources/` (`<stem>.md` and archived `.txt` / `.csv` / `.json` / `.yaml`), never from the digest; `*.conversion_profile.json` and `*_files/image_manifest.json` are sidecars. A source deck's identity is reference, not constraint.

**User images**: if the user provided images, run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` before the Design Spec and read `analysis/image_analysis.csv` before §VIII. The CSV is a regenerated view of `images/`: rerun after any change, never treat it as a store. Never bulk-open images: Strategist inspects one specifically ambiguous asset under [`strategist-image.md`](../references/strategist-image.md) and records the result in §VIII; Executor inspects one `Existing` / `Sourced` asset only for crop, focal placement, or text contrast.

⛔ **BLOCKING — two-stage confirmation**: the always-on user gate unless explicitly delegated. Stage 1 confirms the communication contract and exactly one template mode (`free_design` or `templates`, the latter expanding the four registered-kind selectors plus supplied roots and requiring at least one selection). Final Stage 2 confirms the complete deck solution plus production mechanics only after the Stage-1 choice is installed or free design is closed; `refine_spec: true` adds one chat gate after Design Spec Gate 1. Author each stage once; submitted values — including blanks and unusual overrides — are authoritative.

**Only the user confirms**: the agent authors recommendations, operates the server, reads state, and applies a template. It never confirms on the user's behalf, automates submission, synthesizes a payload, or writes user result state; silence confirms nothing. Under explicit delegation the agent makes the Stage-1 decision, installs it, derives Stage 2, and presents one complete summary without fabricating UI receipts.

**UI branch** — `template_options.json` (Step 3), `recommendations.stage1.json`, `template_handoff.json` (written only by `--complete-template-selection`), and `recommendations.stage2.json` are agent inputs; `template_selection.json` and `result.json` are user receipts. Only the active unconfirmed stage file may be overwritten, in place, never with a revision suffix or another stage's payload. Author Stage 1 without reading candidates, launch, post the [`confirm-surface.md`](../references/confirm-surface.md) handoff summary, then wait:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --daemon
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --wait-only --wait-stage stage1
```

**Hard rule — Stage 1 is intermediate**: exit `0` here means continue, not finish — no final reply, no idling. Read `result.json` and `template_selection.json` exactly once (a confirmed contract plus either `free_design` with no roots or `templates` with ≥1 server-resolved root), then in the same run:

1. For `templates`, run [`apply-template-workspace.md`](./stages/apply-template-workspace.md) against every confirmed root (each installs as `templates/design_spec.<kind>.<id>.md` plus real `images/` and `icons/`); for `free_design` skip it. Then bind the state — agent-only, never hand-authored:
   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --complete-template-selection
   ```
2. Only now inspect installed template state (apply `strategist-template.md` when active), load the planning-capability block, author the three solutions, freeze and read their exact bases, derive the production defaults, and create `recommendations.stage2.json` (`stage: "stage2"`) without changing Stage 1. Wait:
   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --wait-only
   ```
3. Read the complete `result.json` exactly once and retain it through Design Spec authoring; proceed only on `stage: final` + `status: confirmed`. On a non-zero wait this single read decides whether the persisted result succeeded before the chat fallback; a stage-skip result returns to the missing stage.
4. Always release the server:
   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --shutdown
   ```

If the user selects chat after launch, apply `confirm-surface.md`'s in-run switch and finish every remaining stage in chat without relaunching.

**Chat branch** — present the template mode and Stage-1 contract together and wait for one explicit response (registered candidates shown only when the user chooses `templates`; free design for an ordinary request, template mode for explicit intent or any supplied root, one root preselectable). Create no UI receipts and do not call `--complete-template-selection`. After confirmation, install or fuse selected roots (or close free design), retain that state as the Stage-2 gate, run final Stage 2 in chat, and keep one visible cumulative summary as the final state.

⛔ **GATE — final state → Design Spec → conditional review → lock**: consume every present final value once into the complete, audited `design_spec.md` under [`strategist.md`](../references/strategist.md) §6.2, preserving each field's semantic type (acceptance never turns a Reference or Permission into a Literal) and every production, typography, image-source, and `image_notes` obligation; never reopen `result.json`.

1. Read `${SKILL_DIR}/templates/design_spec_reference.md`; create the complete I–X `design_spec.md` once at the confirmed `design_spec_depth`, without placeholders or `scaffold-*`.
2. Audit it field by field against the retained confirmation — Gate 1.
3. With `refine_spec: true`, run [`refine-spec`](stages/refine-spec.md): review that file in chat, accept arbitrary revisions, touch no lock, stop until explicit approval. Otherwise skip.
4. Read `${SKILL_DIR}/templates/spec_lock_reference.md`; author `spec_lock.md` once from the approved Design Spec and context — identity and refinements, every recurring typography role, routing anchors, each placed image's source/layout suggestion/crop policy; no page-local garnish, no image palette; `strategist-template.md` §3 when active.
5. Compare lock anchors to the Design Spec and run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py validate <project_path>`. Schema validity never proves fidelity: a final-state → Design Spec mismatch, an approved Design Spec → lock mismatch, or an unapplied revision blocks. Repair from the retained confirmation (or the approved revision); resume and refine edit existing files, never scaffolds; only fresh recovery may reread persisted final evidence once. Unhonorable requirements follow [`failure-recovery.md`](governance/failure-recovery.md).

**Confirmation notes**, appended after the stage details in the user's language, each one 💡 line:

| Note | When | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Split-mode note | Only when the confirmed mode is `split` or the run is heavy (long page count, bulky sources, substantial research retained in this chat — an isolated `topic-research` worker's fetches do not count) | Recommend or confirm stopping after Step 5 and entering the execution session with `继续生成 projects/<project_name>` ([`resume-execute`](stages/resume-execute.md)); no response or "continue" means `continuous`, and the default path prints no reminder |
| Spec-refinement note | Always | Offer review of the complete Design Spec before the lock (default OFF; only explicit opt-in or `refine_spec: true` runs `refine-spec`) |

**Production fields**: resolve Speaker Notes, Custom Animations, and Narration Audio as latest explicit user instruction → final Stage-2 proactive value → default `true` / `false` / `false`. Enabled Narration Audio raises a non-explicitly-disabled Speaker Notes outcome and names that dependency. Persist the effective outcomes with provenance as the three rows in `design_spec.md §I`, keep the raw proactive fields as evidence only, and project neither into `spec_lock.md`. A later explicit request updates only its §I outcome and resumes the owning step without reopening Confirm UI. Disabling notes while audio stays enabled asks one question (disable audio too, or keep its required notes) before writing either row.

**Formulas and hyperlinks** are §IX content, not confirmation fields or resources: Strategist records the delimiter-free LaTeX body or the exact URI / 1-based slide target, and Executor chooses the realization (text, inline, or block math; inline or whole-object link carrier) under [`native-formula.md`](../references/native-formula.md) / [`native-hyperlinks.md`](../references/native-hyperlinks.md). No manifest or lock entry exists for either.

**Prepared final narration**: when an explicit final/literal script will become notes or audio, follow `video-design.md` §1 and §3 — segment it by scene in Stage 2, give each segment a supporting visible state in §IX, record source and verbatim policy in §X, and after Gate 2 (before Step 5 or the split handoff) write the exact segments once to `notes/total.md`, split only in Step 7.1.

**Output**: `design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`, and `notes/total.md` only on the narration branch.

**✅ Internal checkpoint** — facts read; confirmation consumed once; production fields, mathematics, per-page `Relationships`, and §VIII resource jobs resolved; Gate 1 passed; refinement approved when enabled; lock derived; split handling resolved; every §IX `Audience move` present. Do not print; auto-proceed.

---

### Step 5: Image Acquisition Phase (Conditional)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 complete; `design_spec.md` and `spec_lock.md` exist (otherwise stop under [`failure-recovery.md`](governance/failure-recovery.md) §3).

**Trigger**: §VIII has at least one `Acquire Via: ai`, `web`, or `slice` row, or a pending derivative declared by `Reference: Derived from <canonical bare filename>; treatment=...`. Prepared-user-only plans and `placeholder` rows do not trigger it; a permitted but unused source creates no row. If §VIII omits a source, asset, or page role that `image_notes` explicitly requires, return to Step 4 Gate 1 and repair from the retained final state.

```
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/image-base.md          # always
```

| Row | Additional reference | Run |
|---|---|---|
| Prepared derivative | `image-generator.md` §4.4 only for registered layers | after its canonical source is terminal: `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/image_treat.py ...` for blur, desaturation/grayscale, duotone, brightness, contrast, or `--fit WxH` downscaling to the planned size, or the §4.4 preparation path |
| `ai` | `image-generator.md` | write `images/image_prompts.json`, render `image_prompts.md` with `image_gen.py --render-md images/image_prompts.json`, then follow §7 Path Selection — `image_gen.py --manifest` is Path A only, `host-native` is Path B and skips `--manifest`, `manual` writes prompts and stops; the recorded `design_spec.md §I` path wins over `IMAGE_BACKEND` |
| `web` | `image-searcher.md` | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/image_search.py ...`; with ≥2 rows write `images/image_queries.json` and run `--batch` once |
| `slice` | `image-generator.md` §4.3 | after the parent sheet is `Generated`: `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/slice_images.py <project_path>/images/<sheet>.png --grid RxC --names ... --trim --alpha --bg KEY_HEX_FROM_PROMPT --strict-alpha` |
| `user` / `placeholder` | — | skip |

Load only the references the rows need; a mixed deck writes both `image_prompts.json` and `image_sources.json`. The positional `image_gen.py "prompt"` form is for out-of-pipeline fixups and the §4.4 reconstruction derivation only.

**Web selection**: when any vision-capable context exists, add `--save-candidates` with explicit `query_variants` and run [`web-image-review`](stages/web-image-review.md). Only a stage-selected candidate is promoted with `--promote`; a row advances to `next_candidate_page` before its query changes, and only an exhausted pool returns it to `Pending` with new variants. Without vision, omit `--save-candidates`: best-only mode downloads a strict metadata-verified candidate (`selection_method: metadata-ranked`) or stops at `Needs-Manual`. Only after normal search is exhausted may a vision-capable owner fetch one [`topic-research`](stages/topic-research.md) `source_url` as a reviewed source package. §VIII `Reference` stays the locked intent; the provider query is authored separately.

🚧 **Exhausted-automation GATE**: `auto` tries Path A then Path B and never silently enters Offline Manual. When both are exhausted, or a confirmed `api` / `host-native` path stays unavailable after retry, ask whether to repair and retry the same path, generate the listed files manually, or cancel the affected AI images and repair the plan; only confirmed `manual` creates `Needs-Manual` rows. Web failures follow [`image-base.md`](../references/image-base.md) §3 without halting: try materially different query/provider/license strategies, then mark `Needs-Manual`, report, and continue.

**Workflow**: run the procedure in [`image-base.md`](../references/image-base.md) §2 — separate derivative rows, group canonical rows by `Acquire Via`, finish each path, slice each generated sheet with its grid, `--names`, and the exact key HEX from its prompt, materialize derivatives only from terminal sources under their declared treatment. Then verify every row is terminal (no `Pending`, `Failed`, or `Needs-Selection`; an unresolved Default AI row waits at the gate above) and run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` so the CSV reflects every placeable image. Every Pending/Failed row reaches a terminal state before Executor starts.

**✅ Internal checkpoint** — sidecars, slice outputs, terminal statuses, refreshed CSV. Do not print. Auto-proceed to Step 6; only `generation_mode: split` prints the handoff and stops this conversation:

```markdown
## ✅ Planning Session Complete
- [x] Spec: `design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`
- [x] Resources: `sources/`, `images/`, `templates/`
- [ ] **Next**: open a fresh chat window and input `继续生成 projects/<project_name>` to enter the execution session via the [`resume-execute`](stages/resume-execute.md) stage.
```

---

### Step 6: Executor Phase

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 (and Step 5 if triggered) complete.

```
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/executor-base.md              # REQUIRED core: execution rules, device menu, everyday effects, module triggers
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/shared-standards-core.md      # REQUIRED core: SVG contract + shared aesthetic/leading baseline
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/semantic-svg.md               # REQUIRED core: semantic metadata boundary
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/preset-shape-vocabulary.md    # REQUIRED core: complete 187-name preset vocabulary
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/modes/<resolved-id>.md        # one preset id, or each `mode_references` id
Read ${SKILL_DIR}/references/visual-styles/<resolved-id>.md # one preset id, or each `visual_style_references` id
# Triggered modules — evaluate executor-base.md's routing table over the §IX roster before P01
# and read every triggered module in this same batch.
```

Read the core as one batch with the exact detail files named by the retained `spec_lock.md`, then every module the roster sweep triggers. Never reopen the planning indexes, infer adjacent bases, glob a catalog, or blend unselected identities (an unreferenced custom follows its behavior alone). Conditional modules load on [`executor-base.md`](../references/executor-base.md)'s routing table, never by analogy; `video-design.md` is read before the first SVG when §I records recorded/self-running/video delivery or §X a literal script. Read each reference once per valid context.

**Context validity**: reuse the retained Design Spec and lock for every page while the context is unchanged and uncompacted; do not reread or poll them. On local uncertainty consult the retained lock, then only the owning Design Spec fragment — sources supply facts only, and the Design Spec wins a conflict.

| Situation | Read |
|---|---|
| Fresh, resumed, restarted, compacted, or externally changed context | `design_spec.md`, then `spec_lock.md`, once, plus triggered references and the latest completed SVG when mid-deck ([`failure-recovery.md`](governance/failure-recovery.md)) |
| Bounded same-context repair that preserves roster/order/identity/communication | Only the affected fragment readback plus `project_manager.py validate` |
| **Five-page lock re-read** — after P05, P10, P15, … when another page follows | `spec_lock.md` in full once before the next page: a pure re-anchor of palette, typography, icon style, and `page_rhythm` under long context, with no checker run, no output, no pause, and no repair loop; an external change found here follows the recovery branch |
| §X records a literal script | The frozen `notes/total.md` once before P01; design each visible state around its segment |
| Missing `spec_lock.md` or `design_spec.md` | Stop and report the missing gate artifact; recover through [`failure-recovery.md`](governance/failure-recovery.md) §3; a missing field in an existing lock → its §2 |

**Hard rule — exact page roster**: `design_spec.md §IX` is the ordered queue — one final slide per entry, same id and order; never add, drop, merge, split, or reorder while drawing. A continuous run may first repair the affected §IX blocks and `page_rhythm` rows and rerun `validate` while the count stays inside the Stage-1 confirmed range; leaving that range reconfirms Stage 1. §IX is preferred wording and semantic authority, adapted only under `executor-base.md` §2.1's content-vs-expression contract, with sources read only for verification.

**Image inventory**: trust the latest `analysis/image_analysis.csv` (rerun `analyze_images.py` if `images/` changed; an empty folder means no inventory). `page-context` is a diagnostic only ([`artifact-ownership.md`](../references/artifact-ownership.md) §1).

**Design Parameter Confirmation (Mandatory)**: before the first SVG, output one confirmation listing the compact communication objective, canvas dimensions, body font size, color scheme (primary/secondary/accent HEX), font plan, the per-role calibration table, and the live-preview URL from the launcher below. The calibration table comes from `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/text_measure.py calibrate <project_path> --outline`: every lock role with family, size, CJK and Latin ≈ chars per 100 px, and the longest planned §IX line per role in px — the checker's own estimator with wrapping headroom, written to `validation/text_calibration.json`. If the preview failed to launch, say so here rather than proceeding silently.

**Live Preview Auto-Startup (Mandatory)**: before the first SVG, start the editor and keep it running through Step 7:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_editor/server.py <project_path> --live --daemon
```

Default first free port from `6060` (`--port N` binds strictly); read the URL from output or `<project_path>/live_preview/lock.json` and report it — or the launch failure, or that the user or run instructions forbade starting it — before the first SVG. It is a side process: never wait for it or for user confirmation, and keep it running until the user clicks **Exit preview** or asks in chat. Do not read or apply submitted annotations during generation; that window opens after Step 7 ([`live-preview.md`](stages/live-preview.md), which also describes staged direct edits).

**Cadence (Mandatory)**: P01–P05 → early gate (a planned roster of six or fewer pages skips it) → remaining pages → final gate, in one context. Every checker invocation follows one of two events: a gate point whose covered pages all exist, or the end of one consolidated repair pass. A run with neither predecessor is a pacing violation; validating an authoring pattern early is not a reason, because the same issues surface at the gate and are fixed in the same pass. Reload under Context validity above after context invalidation.

**Visual Construction Phase**: generate pages sequentially into `<project_path>/svg_output/`. Each SVG carries the slide's complete visible design (a JSON-first Chart/Table is the sole exception: inline JSON authoritative, visible subtree an approximate preview). Native shapes follow [`native-shape-authoring.md`](../references/native-shape-authoring.md), loaded at the first contour beyond basic primitives while the preset vocabulary is read before page one: independent atoms first, Merge Shapes only when contour semantics require it, freeform last.

| Structure | Page authoring |
|---|---|
| `mirror` / `layout` | Start from the complete `page_layouts` SVG and preserve inherited visuals, root identity, atoms, and slots. Strict keeps the contract; `layout` may reflow carrier text inside unchanged slot bounds; adaptive uses a Strategist-declared Layout. A required atom or slot change returns upstream; Executor never edits `spec_lock.md`. |
| `style`, free design, brand-only | Flat per `executor-base.md` and [`semantic-svg.md`](../references/semantic-svg.md). |

**Motion endpoints**: when custom motion is active — an explicit user motion instruction, an enabled Custom Animations outcome in §I, or an existing `animations.json` — author the visible endpoint states now under [`executor-base.md`](../references/executor-base.md) §1; a §IX suggestion alone activates nothing.

**Early gate (Mandatory)** — after the fifth SVG, before page 6; a planned roster of six or fewer pages skips this gate and goes straight to the final gate:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path> \
  --canonical-authoring --stage early --json
```

`--json` writes the report file (`validation/svg_quality_early_report.json`); stdout stays the human-readable summary and is never parsed as JSON. The stage checks every authored page so far under the partial-roster rules. Repair under the consolidated-pass discipline in [`executor-base.md`](../references/executor-base.md) §3; a still-failing verification is the next batch. If terminal output is truncated, extract only `categories.blocking.issues` (and `categories.introduced.issues` when needed) from `validation/svg_quality_early_report.json`. The gate validates the method, not just the pages — emit one line before editing (in the conversation, not to a file):

```
gate-signal: method=<rule resolved, or none> | page-local=<count> | not-exercised=<list>
```

| Signal | Reading |
|---|---|
| Two or more issues share a category and direction — on one page or across pages — or one issue sits in a writing form the deck repeats on every page (a paragraph construction, a header line, a card frame), which a long deck copies before the final gate | Method-level bias — resolve to the authoritative rule before P06 (for text extents: correct the per-role calibration table — rerun `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/text_measure.py calibrate <project_path> --outline` or add the missing `--role` — then every later page estimates by that arithmetic and measures nothing); a correction fitted to the observed offset patches only this sample |
| One isolated issue tied to a single page's structure | Page-local — fix and continue |
| A recurring element (furniture, caption format, section numbering, accent discipline) drifts between its occurrences or is still unsettled | It will be copied to every later page — settle its semantics now |

`not-exercised` names what P01–P05 could not test (five pages usually exercise multi-line text, columns, and captions; charts, tables, or other data objects may still be pending); carry each resolved rule forward as arithmetic. Every later page runs without checker calls; a listed item first exercised later is held to the carried-forward rule and caught by the final gate.

**Quality Check Gate (Mandatory)** — only after every planned SVG exists, before annotations and speaker notes:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path> \
  --canonical-authoring --stage final --json
```

- Before the gate, every §IX `Native-ready` `<object-key>=yes` has its draw-time marker group and JSON child; `=no` and incidental microvisuals stay ordinary SVG (a legacy bare `yes|no` is readable only when the page has exactly one eligible object). JSON-first Chart/Table validates inline schema/bounds; SVG-first markers need a current `data-pptx-fallback-sha256`, stamped after synchronization — missing or stale baselines block canonical/native export, not fallback export.
- `--json` writes `validation/svg_quality_report.json`, the report the exporter fingerprints against `svg_output/`; stdout stays the human-readable summary and is never parsed as JSON. Without `--json` the export is refused.
- One run against `svg_output/` reports every page; repair under the consolidated-pass discipline in [`executor-base.md`](../references/executor-base.md) §3. If output is truncated, extract only `categories.blocking.issues` (and `categories.introduced.issues` when needed) from that run's `validation/svg_quality_report.json`, where `inherited` and `source-import` are provenance and `introduced` holds changed/new warnings.
- Structured-template warnings (empty/framing-only Layout, bare Master, duplicate layout keys) guide optional cleanup only; a condition that must be corrected before release is an `error`.
- **Hard rule — token-safe report handling**: on success use the exit status and terminal summary; never `cat` the complete JSON into context. Read it only for failure investigation, an explicit audit, or a field absent from stdout.

**Mandatory — final carrier-receipt review**: run the review in [`executor-base.md`](../references/executor-base.md) §3 Checkpoints against the retained §IX page jobs, resource roles, and geometry signatures; a repair reruns the final checker once.

**Logic Construction Phase (conditional)**: when the effective Speaker Notes outcome in §I is enabled, load [`executor-notes.md`](../references/executor-notes.md): validate a frozen `notes/total.md` against every information-bearing final SVG group (repair the page or the plan, never the script), or otherwise ground each page's narration in its final SVG and write `notes/total.md`. When disabled, load nothing and create no notes.

**✅ Internal checkpoint** — preview launched in time, early gate after P05 (skipped on a roster of six or fewer pages), uninterrupted remaining pages, consolidated repair, exact §IX coverage, one-frame prose, final checker 0 errors, `notes/total.md` only when enabled. Do not print. Then run the applicable conditional gates and proceed to Step 7.

> **Chart pages?** Run [`verify-charts`](stages/verify-charts.md) before Step 7 to calibrate coordinates; skip without chart pages.
>
> **Visual self-check (opt-in)?** Run [`visual-review`](stages/visual-review.md) before Step 7 only when the user explicitly asked for a per-page visual re-pass ("跑一下视觉自检 / 视觉回看", "visual review", "check pages visually"); never by default, on inferred model capability, or on deck size.
>
> **Motion execution (conditional)?** An existing `animations.json` always runs [`customize-animations`](stages/customize-animations.md) before export. Without a sidecar, run it only for an explicit per-slide/per-object request or an enabled Custom Animations outcome in §I (§IX suggestions inform it, never trigger it); a deck-wide request loads [`animations.md`](../references/animations.md) and resolves Step 7.3 flags instead; otherwise keep `fade` / `none` and load nothing. Executor owns effects, options, order, timing, and simplification to `none`; never add motion for coverage. Sound is never a Strategist resource: no id or path in `design_spec.md` / `spec_lock.md`, and any cue is selected only after the motion solution is final under `animations.md` §2.2.

### Step 7: Post-processing & Export

🚧 **GATE**: Step 6 complete — every final page in `svg_output/`, all conditional gates passed, final report 0 errors, and `notes/total.md` covering every page when Speaker Notes is enabled.

🚧 **Image readiness GATE**: when any required row is `Needs-Manual`, every expected file and slice output must exist under `images/` before the first Step 7 command. If any is absent, pause and list the exact filenames; never run `finalize_svg.py` or `svg_to_pptx.py`, never ship the dashed placeholder. When the files arrive, rerun `analyze_images.py`, replace each placeholder, reconcile every `no-crop` container to the measured native ratio, and rerun the final checker (which then closes each terminal §VIII row through `spec_lock.md images`, the exact file, and a real `<image href>`, and validates Sourced provenance, visible credits, and per-placement pixel scale under `meet` / `slice` / `none`).

**Hard rule — strict serial commands**: one command at a time, each in its own invocation; enter the next sub-step only after the current one exits successfully and its success criterion holds. On failure, repair the owning source artifact and resume from the failed sub-step ([`failure-recovery.md`](./governance/failure-recovery.md)); never restart planning unless its source changed.

#### Step 7.1 — Split Speaker Notes (only when enabled)

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>
```

**Success criterion**: per-slide Markdown files under `notes/` cover every published slide. When disabled, skip to 7.2.

#### Step 7.2 — Build the Self-Contained SVG Preview

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>
```

**Success criterion**: `svg_final/` holds one self-contained preview per slide. Its absence never blocks 7.3.

#### Step 7.3 — Export the Native PPTX

| Effective decision | Command |
|---|---|
| Speaker Notes `enabled` | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path>` |
| Speaker Notes `disabled` | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --no-notes` |

| Decision | Flag |
|---|---|
| Explicit editable Chart/Table delivery decision, or a structured `chart` / `table` placeholder slot | Append `--native-charts-and-tables` (markers, templates, semantic tables, and imported charts never activate it; formulas are always native) |
| Final checker reports oversized images | Append `--image-sizing display` |
| Preserved or produced `animations.json` | Keep the base command; the exporter reads the sidecar |
| Deck-wide motion setting | Append the resolved [`animations.md`](../references/animations.md) flags |
| Explicit Custom Animations disable | Keep the sidecar and append `-a none` |
| Explicit all-motion disable | `--no-animations` |
| Final Stage-2 `false` | Neither flag |
| Conversion trace | Do not add `--conversion-trace` to every base export; an explicit `--conversion-trace <path>` writes to that destination instead of the default |

Sound: the optional post-motion pass is [`animations.md`](../references/animations.md) §2.2. For a narrated MP4, [`generate-audio`](stages/generate-audio.md) owns the delivery choice.

**Success criterion**: the command exits 0 and produces `exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>.pptx`, `validation/<project_name>_<timestamp>.report.json` with `passed` or `passed-with-warnings`, and `validation/<project_name>_<timestamp>.trace.json` when `--conversion-trace` was enabled. The exporter itself requires the current matching `final` quality report and exits nonzero on a missing, unreadable, unsupported, non-final, blocking, stale, or unverifiable one. Read the compact `[POSTFLIGHT]` receipt (`status`, `quality_gate`, slide count, warning counts, paths), disclose material warnings, and never `cat` the full report on success. Retain the report path for a later `deck_motion` handoff; postflight proves the package, not a later MP4 audio track.

### Revision Round (delivered project)

A delivered project that comes back with a change stays in this route; planning does not restart. Act at the owning layer. A wording change, an added condition, or a re-titled page edits the SVG, then its §IX block, `notes/total.md`, and every page that repeats the line (a chapter page's route, the contents page). A page inserted, dropped, or moved renumbers the roster first — files, footers, contents-page numbers, §IX blocks, `page_rhythm` / `page_visualizations` rows, `animations.json` keys, `notes/total.md` headings — then authors or removes the page; whatever the moved page carried moves with it: a Morph `from` names the new preceding page and a "next chapter" preview group follows its boundary. A deck-wide colour or family runs [`update_spec.py`](../scripts/docs/update_spec.md); derived tints, pages designed around the old value, and spec prose naming it are edited by hand, and a hand-edited Chart/Table fallback is re-stamped before the gate. Rerun the final quality gate (it compares §IX with `svg_output/`), `animation_config.py validate`, 7.1 when notes changed, 7.2, and 7.3; calibration, the early gate, and `verify-charts` return only when a type role, the first pages, or a chart's geometry changed. Earlier exports stay; the new ones carry their own timestamp.

## ✅ Generate PPTX Complete

- [x] Image readiness gate passed
- [x] Every checker invocation followed a gate point (early after P05 on a roster of seven or more pages, final after the complete roster) or one consolidated repair pass — never a page in progress or an individual fix
- [x] Carrier receipt compared with the retained page decisions; contradictions repaired without treating counts as quotas
- [x] Notes split when enabled; disabled exports used `--no-notes`
- [x] `svg_final/` preview built
- [x] Native PPTX published and postflight report written
- [ ] **Next**: report the exported PPTX path; when the effective Narration Audio outcome in `design_spec.md §I` is enabled, run [`generate-audio`](stages/generate-audio.md); otherwise run a supporting post-export stage only on its explicit trigger
