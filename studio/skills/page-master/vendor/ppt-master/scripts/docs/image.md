# Image Tools

Image tools cover prompt-based AI generation, web image search, image inspection,
and Gemini watermark removal. Native formula authoring belongs to the SVG
pipeline, not the image pipeline.

## Legacy standalone `latex_render.py`

This retained standalone utility renders a user-authored
`images/formula_manifest.json` to PNG. Neither Default nor Quick Generate calls
it, and new projects do not create formula manifests or formula images. The
supported generated-deck path authors a native formula marker in SVG and lets
`svg_to_pptx.py` compile its LaTeX payload to editable PowerPoint OMML.

```bash
python3 scripts/latex_render.py <project_path>
python3 scripts/latex_render.py <project_path> --dry-run
```

Use it only for an explicitly requested external raster workflow. It is not a
compatibility fallback for Keynote, WPS, LibreOffice, or another client.

## `image_gen.py`

Unified image generation entry point.

This script is the **Path A** API/proxy executor for generated images. Default
Generate checks `design_spec.md §I / AI Image Acquisition Path` before manifest
mode: only `api` / `auto` permits Path A; a missing or unknown value fails
closed and returns to Step 4 recovery. Quick Generate has no Design Spec: use
the explicit active-context path when supplied, otherwise `auto` selects the
A → B chain defined in
[`image-generator.md`](../../references/image-generator.md) §7 without asking;
exhausted automation triggers Quick's no-AI replan rather than Offline Manual.
In either profile, `host-native` uses the host image tool directly and an
explicit `manual` choice uses the read-only Markdown sidecar.

```bash
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "A modern futuristic workspace"
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "Abstract tech background" --aspect_ratio 16:9 --image_size 4K
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "Concept car" -o projects/demo/images
python3 scripts/image_gen.py --list-backends
```

Backends are grouped into Core / Extended / Experimental tiers. Run `python3 scripts/image_gen.py --list-backends` for the current list.

Each backend accepts its own subset of `--aspect_ratio` values; the authority is the `VALID_ASPECT_RATIOS` constant in its `scripts/image_backends/backend_<name>.py`, and `--manifest` rejects an unsupported ratio before any request. Gemini 3.1 image models take `1:1 1:4 1:8 2:3 3:2 3:4 4:1 4:3 4:5 5:4 8:1 9:16 16:9 21:9` (no `3:1`); the `gemini-2.5-flash-image` models take only `1:1 2:3 3:2 3:4 4:3 4:5 5:4 9:16 16:9 21:9` at `1K`.

Backend selection:

```bash
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "A cat" --backend openai
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "A cinematic portrait" --backend minimax
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "A product launch hero image" --backend qwen
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "科技感背景图" --backend zhipu
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "A product KV in cinematic style" --backend volcengine
python3 scripts/image_gen.py "A mountain landscape" --backend tencent
```

Configuration sources:

1. Current process environment variables
2. First `.env` found in this order:
   - Current working directory
   - Skill directory (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/ppt-master/.env`)
   - Clone repo root
   - `~/.ppt-master/.env`

The active backend must always be selected explicitly via `IMAGE_BACKEND`.

Example `.env`:

```env
IMAGE_BACKEND=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-image-2
# Optional proxy
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1
# OpenAI-compatible provider knobs:
# OPENAI_SIZE_PRESET=auto
# OPENAI_RESPONSE_FORMAT=auto
# OPENAI_QUALITY=auto
# Allowed values: png / jpeg / webp
# OPENAI_OUTPUT_FORMAT=png
# jpeg/webp only, 0-100
# OPENAI_OUTPUT_COMPRESSION=80
# gpt-image-2: auto / opaque
# OPENAI_BACKGROUND=auto
# auto / low
# OPENAI_MODERATION=auto
```

Example process environment:

```bash
export IMAGE_BACKEND=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-image-2
export OPENAI_OUTPUT_FORMAT=png
```

Current process environment wins over `.env`.

OpenAI backend notes:
- `gpt-image-2` is the default OpenAI model.
- Requests are sent with plain `requests.post()` to improve compatibility with
  OpenAI-compatible proxies that block the OpenAI SDK's `httpx` transport.
- For `gpt-image-2`, `image_size=512px` means a low-quality draft preset, not a literal 512px edge. The model requires both edges to be multiples of 16px, a long:short ratio no greater than 3:1, and total pixels between 655,360 and 8,294,400.
- `OPENAI_BACKGROUND=transparent` is not supported by `gpt-image-2`; use `auto` or `opaque`.
- If `OPENAI_OUTPUT_FORMAT=jpeg` or `webp`, generated files use `.jpg` or `.webp` extensions instead of `.png`.
- OpenAI-compatible providers that reject OpenAI-specific fields can use `OPENAI_RESPONSE_FORMAT=omit`, `OPENAI_QUALITY=omit`, and `OPENAI_SIZE_PRESET=<preset>`. Valid response formats are `auto`, `b64_json`, `url`, and `omit`; valid size presets are `auto`, `legacy`, `gpt-image`, `gpt-image-2`, and `dall-e-2`.

Example `.env` for Agnes AI through the OpenAI-compatible backend:

```env
IMAGE_BACKEND=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-agnes-key
OPENAI_MODEL=agnes-image-2.1-flash
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1
OPENAI_SIZE_PRESET=gpt-image-2
OPENAI_RESPONSE_FORMAT=omit
OPENAI_QUALITY=omit
```

Use provider-specific keys only (e.g. `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`). See `.env.example` in clone mode or `${SKILL_DIR}/.env.example` in skill-install mode for the full list per backend.

`IMAGE_API_KEY`, `IMAGE_MODEL`, and `IMAGE_BASE_URL` are intentionally unsupported.

If you keep multiple providers in one `.env` or environment, `IMAGE_BACKEND` must explicitly select the active provider.

Recommendation:
- Default to the Core tier for routine PPT work
- Use Extended only when you need a specific model style
- Treat Experimental backends as opt-in

Example `.env` for MiniMax image backend:

```env
IMAGE_BACKEND=minimax
MINIMAX_API_KEY=your-api-key
# Optional: override base URL (defaults to https://api.minimaxi.com, domestic China endpoint)
# Use https://api.minimax.io for overseas access
# MINIMAX_BASE_URL=https://api.minimax.io
# MINIMAX_MODEL=image-01
```

## `image_gen.py --manifest` runner and legacy manifest spellings

Validates the file behind every `Generated` row before skipping it, iterates retryable rows with bounded adaptive concurrency, and writes each status atomically; a missing or corrupt file returns to `Failed`, and persistent rate limits end the run as retryable `Failed`. Options: `--concurrency` (default `IMAGE_CONCURRENCY` or 3; halves on rate limit, min 1), `--image_size`, `--output`/`-o`, `--backend`/`-b`, `--model`/`-m`, `--list-backends`. Interrupting is safe (completed items stay `Generated`); the Markdown sidecar re-renders on completion, or run `--render-md` after an interruption. Configuration: process environment first, then the first `.env` in cwd, the skill directory, the clone root, `~/.ppt-master/.env` — `IMAGE_BACKEND` (required; `--list-backends` shows the set and support tiers), `IMAGE_CONCURRENCY`, provider-specific `{PROVIDER}_API_KEY` / `_BASE_URL` / `_MODEL` (never `IMAGE_API_KEY` / `IMAGE_MODEL` / `IMAGE_BASE_URL`), and for OpenAI-compatible platforms `OPENAI_SIZE_PRESET` (`auto|legacy|gpt-image|gpt-image-2|dall-e-2`), `OPENAI_RESPONSE_FORMAT` (`auto|b64_json|url|omit`), `OPENAI_QUALITY` (`auto|omit|low|medium|high|standard|hd`) under `IMAGE_BACKEND=openai`; see `.env.example`. The single-image form `image_gen.py "prompt" --filename …` remains for ad-hoc re-rolls.

**Compatibility**: legacy `type` values read as `background` → `hero_page` + no type, `hero` → `hero_page` + Primitive A, `portrait` → `local` + Primitive B, `typography` → `hero_page` + `embedded` + Primitive C; a missing `page_role` is `local`, a missing `text_policy` is `none` (one aggregate warning per manifest); an existing manifest lacking `deck_rendering` or an item lacking `type` replays its assembled `prompt` verbatim without reconstruction; a legacy `deck_style_anchor` or `deck_palette` never overrides `deck_rendering` / `color_scheme`; legacy `page_role: full_page` reads as `hero_page`.

## `image_treat.py`

Create a non-destructive PNG derivative from one bitmap already prepared under
`<project_path>/images/`. Use this only when a slide needs a baked bitmap effect;
crop, mask, rotation, mirror, opacity, shadow, scrim, outline, and overlap remain
native SVG/PPT treatments. This tool does not perform semantic background
removal: use `slice_images.py --alpha --bg <key> --strict-alpha` for flat-color
keys (a pure red/green/blue key also recovers soft alpha and removes spill from
key-dominant blends, leaving an opaque foreground of the key's hue untouched; thin
dark strokes of that hue can still fringe, so choose the key by hue absence;
strict alpha diagnoses off-key haze from the four 10% key-only margins, allowing
soft shadows and glows on a clean key), an
already prepared RGBA asset or the active host image editor for a standalone cutout, and
[`image-generator.md`](../../references/image-generator.md) §4.4 only for
registered subject/base layers.

```bash
python3 scripts/image_treat.py projects/demo hero.jpg \
  --output hero_soft.png --brightness 0.9 --contrast 1.1 --blur 12

python3 scripts/image_treat.py projects/demo hero.jpg \
  --output hero_duotone.png --duotone "#14213D" "#FCA311"

python3 scripts/image_treat.py projects/demo title_art.png \
  --output title_art_fit.png --fit 920x228
```

Supported operations are brightness, contrast, desaturation/grayscale,
duotone, Gaussian blur, and `--fit WxH` (downscale to fit inside a pixel
box, aspect ratio and alpha preserved; never upscales). They compose in a
fixed order: brightness → contrast → tone treatment → blur → fit. Desaturation, grayscale, and duotone are
mutually exclusive. At least one option must produce a real change; animated
sources are rejected rather than reduced to one frame, while a camera
multi-picture JPEG (MPO) contributes its primary frame.

Both input and output are bare filenames directly under `images/`; output must
be a new `.png` file, or a new `.jpg` file when the source is opaque (a
photograph downscaled with `--fit` keeps its weight in check that way; a
source with transparency is refused for `.jpg`). The tool keeps the EXIF-corrected display dimensions,
leaves any alpha mask unchanged, and never overwrites the source or an existing
derivative. If `images/image_sources.json` contains the source filename, the
new record inherits that legal provenance and records `derived_from` plus the
ordered `treatments`. Run `analyze_images.py` after all planned derivatives are
ready so the inventory reflects the files that SVG authoring will consume.

## `analyze_images.py`

Analyze objective image-file facts in a project directory before writing the
design spec or authoring SVG.

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images
```

The tool does not resolve a canvas or recommend a left/right, top/bottom, or
other slide layout. Its atomic CSV records EXIF-corrected native dimensions and
`AspectRatio`, the objective aspect-ratio category, optional source
`SourceDisplayRatio`, format, actual transparent-pixel presence, usage count,
and bitmap/vector capability facts. The usage count (`Uses` in the table) is
how many source occurrences the import manifest recorded for the asset; it is
not a count of SVG references and does not find unused assets. An empty folder rewrites a header-only
report; unreadable supported files still refresh the report and produce a
non-zero exit.

Use this as the default factual inventory; it does not perform semantic image
understanding or choose composition. Generate planning follows the Strategist's
context-first boundary: source context, captions / alt text / titles, filenames,
user notes, and existing resource records come first. Only an already-selected
provided/web asset whose focal-safe crop, overlay contrast, or quiet region
remains materially ambiguous may be inspected for that placement; this never
reopens selection or provenance, never bulk-opens the image folder, and never
restores routine readback of AI-generated images.

## `image_search.py`

Zero-config web image search across openly-licensed providers. Sister tool to `image_gen.py` — used when the resource list row has `Acquire Via: web`.

```bash
python3 scripts/image_search.py "offshore wind farm" \
  --filename cover_bg.jpg --slide 01_cover \
  --orientation landscape -o projects/demo/images
```

For multiple web rows, `--batch images/image_queries.json` searches them concurrently (modest default, `--concurrency N` / `IMAGE_SEARCH_CONCURRENCY` to tune) instead of one call per row — the web sister of `image_gen.py --manifest`. Schema and status semantics: [`image-searcher.md`](../../references/image-searcher.md) §5.

Providers (Pexels / Pixabay are tried first when keyed; Openverse and Wikimedia are zero-config fallbacks):

| Provider | Config | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| `pexels` | recommended: `PEXELS_API_KEY` | modern stock photography, people, workplace, lifestyle |
| `pixabay` | recommended: `PIXABAY_API_KEY` | broad type coverage including photos and illustrations |
| `openverse` | zero-config | fallback aggregator: Wikimedia + Flickr + museums + rawpixel |
| `wikimedia` | zero-config | educational, scientific, geographic, historical |

Default search chain (when `--provider` is unset): configured Pexels, configured Pixabay, Openverse, then Wikimedia. Missing keyed credentials are silently skipped. Keyed providers broaden stock-photo coverage but are optional; zero-config providers remain valid.

`image_search.py` uses the same `.env` lookup order as `image_gen.py`, so skill installs can keep `PEXELS_API_KEY` / `PIXABAY_API_KEY` in `~/.ppt-master/.env`.

Query guidance:

Keep the Design Spec §VIII `Reference` as the full visual/crop intent; write a separate concise provider query for this CLI. Start with the shortest phrase that preserves identity, but retain exact multi-word names and necessary disambiguators beyond four words.

For exact entities with multiple common names, add repeatable `--query-variant`
values (batch: `query_variants`) for materially different official
translations, spellings, aliases, or Chinese names. Results are aggregated and
deduplicated before ranking.

| Case | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Generic stock concept | `boardroom meeting` |
| China-specific landmark | Precise official place/identity name plus necessary geography |
| Avoid | Negative prompt wording such as `not tourist snapshot` |

License filter:

- **Default**: search all providers with `cc0,pdm,pexels,pixabay,cc by,cc by-sa` allowed together. The chosen image may be `no-attribution` or `attribution-required`; Executor adds an inline credit only when needed.
- `--strict-no-attribution` restricts the search to `cc0,pdm,pexels,pixabay` — useful for full-bleed hero images or templates that cannot host a credit element.

Pin a provider, refuse attribution, or override the manifest path:

```bash
# Pin Wikimedia
python3 scripts/image_search.py "Olympics opening ceremony" \
  --filename event.jpg --provider wikimedia \
  --orientation landscape -o projects/demo/images

# Strict mode — refuse CC BY / CC BY-SA
python3 scripts/image_search.py "abstract gradient" \
  --filename hero.jpg --strict-no-attribution \
  -o projects/demo/images
```

Suitability & manual replacement (a web top hit is metadata-relevant, not guaranteed visually right):

- By default only the best match is downloaded, plus a downscaled review copy at `images/.review/<stem>.jpg` (the placed asset stays full-resolution). A downloaded camera multi-picture JPEG (MPO, common among Commons originals) is rewritten as its primary frame before validation so every later consumer sees a single-frame JPEG.
- For exact subjects (landmarks, people, companies, products), use `--require-terms` or batch `required_terms` so visually plausible but wrong metadata is rejected before ranking. Example: `--require-terms Chongqing --require-terms "Jiefangbei|Liberation Monument"`. Keep proper-name / geography anchors; do not broaden to generic terms like `canyon`, `stone pillar`, or `ancient town` just to improve coverage.
- When the current Generate agent can inspect images, use `--save-candidates`. The tool saves only the first ranked page of review-eligible provider previews (**8 by default**), writes `candidates/<stem>/review_sheet.jpg`, and leaves the target image and `image_sources.json` untouched. Standalone CLI use remains best-only unless this flag is explicit.
- Compare the thumbnail set against the active Reference/Crop Policy. Only after one passes, run `--promote candidate_03.jpg --filename <name>.jpg`; this downloads and validates exactly that original. In batch mode, pass the same `--batch images/image_queries.json` so `Needs-Selection` becomes `Sourced`.
- If no thumbnail passes and `has_more_candidates` is true, fetch `--candidate-page 2` with the same query and filename — the pool's saved `required_terms`, `query_variants`, orientation, and minimum dimensions are inherited unless given again, and a changed query is refused as a page continuation (start a new page-1 pool instead). In batch mode pass `--candidate-page 2` to rerun every `Needs-Selection` row at that page, or set one row's `candidate_page` to `next_candidate_page` and reset only it to `Pending`. Candidate numbering continues at 9, earlier pages stay in `candidates.json` (`saved_pages`) so any saved thumbnail remains promotable, and no original is downloaded. Only after the pool is exhausted should you materially change the identity wording, viewpoint, translation, alias, or disambiguator and generate a fresh pool.
- Without multimodal inspection, omit `--save-candidates`. Best-only mode rejects visual-verification-required near matches, accepts only a strict metadata candidate, downloads one original, and records `selection_method: metadata-ranked`; if metadata cannot prove the entity or the active visual requirement, use `Needs-Manual` rather than claiming visual confirmation.
- `--from-url <url> --filename <name>.jpg` downloads a user-chosen image URL and replaces the target (recorded `license_tier: manual`) — the model-agnostic manual path; works even without a multimodal model.

Full review / escalation flow: [`image-searcher.md`](../../references/image-searcher.md) §5.

Output:

- `--save-candidates`: thumbnail-only `candidates/<stem>/candidates.json`, at most 8 provider previews by default, and `review_sheet.jpg`; no target image or provenance entry. `--candidate-page N` advances through the ranked pool while keeping earlier pages' entries in `candidates.json`; `--max-candidates 0` explicitly dumps all candidates for exceptional debugging
- Best-only / `--promote`: one original saved to the specified output directory (auto-converts webp → jpg via Pillow when the filename extension demands)
- Best-only / `--promote`: `image_sources.json` manifest with full provenance (provider, license, license_tier, author, source URL, dimensions, attribution_text)
- Manifest is idempotent on `filename` and written atomically; damaged existing provenance blocks replacement

Allowed licenses (default): CC0, Public Domain, Pexels License, Pixabay Content License, CC BY, CC BY-SA. Auto-rejected: CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-NC-ND, all rights reserved, unknown.

### `image_search.py` parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `query` (positional, required) | — | Simplified internally |
| `--query-variant` | — | Repeatable alias/translation; batch rows use `query_variants` |
| `--filename` (required) | — | Output filename matching the resource list |
| `-o / --output` | `.` | Output directory; manifest defaults to `<output>/image_sources.json` |
| `--slide`, `--purpose`, `--orientation` | `""`, `""`, `any` | Recorded slide id; `background` / `hero` / `side` / `accent`; `landscape` / `portrait` / `square` |
| `--min-width / --min-height` | `1200 / 800` | Downloaded-pixel floors; `--from-url` honors explicit lower overrides |
| `--provider` | chain | Pin one provider |
| `--strict-no-attribution` | off | Refuse CC BY / CC BY-SA |
| `--require-terms` | — | Repeatable identity gate; comma separates groups, `A|B` aliases |
| `--save-candidates` | off | Thumbnail mode: one ranked page of previews plus `review_sheet.jpg`, no original |
| `--max-candidates` | `8` | Page size; `0` = complete pool, debugging only |
| `--candidate-page` | `1` | Ranked page; page 2 starts at rank 9. Single-query continuation inherits the saved pool request; batch reruns every `Needs-Selection` row at that page |
| `--promote <candidate>` | — | Download exactly one selected original, enforce gates, write provenance |
| `--from-url <url>` | — | Manual replacement recorded as `license_tier: manual`; works without vision |
| `--manifest <path>` | `images/image_queries.json` | Override the manifest path |

### Batch runner and ranking

Required per item: `filename`, `query`, `status`; optional: `query_variants`, `candidate_page`, `slide`, `purpose`, `orientation`, `provider`, `strict_no_attribution`, `min_width`, `min_height`, `required_terms`. The runner revalidates every `Sourced` row against its file, dimensions, and manifest entry (drift → `Failed`), then searches all `Pending` / `Failed` rows concurrently (default concurrency 3, `--concurrency N` or `IMAGE_SEARCH_CONCURRENCY`; `1` for strict pacing on rate-sensitive free providers). Thumbnail mode writes `Needs-Selection` with `candidate_page`, `candidate_count`, `candidate_total`, `has_more_candidates`, `next_candidate_page`, and the `review_sheet` path, creating no image or provenance; to see the next page for one row set its `candidate_page` to `next_candidate_page`, reset only that row to `Pending`, and rerun; `--candidate-page N` on the batch run advances every `Needs-Selection` row at once. A positional query is rejected in batch mode rather than ignored. Promoting with the same `--batch` manifest moves the row to `Sourced`. Provider failures stay retryable `Failed`; clean exhaustion becomes `Needs-Manual`; status is saved after each completion.

**Ranking** orders provider metadata, never pixels, and must not be tuned into a taste engine: hard-reject invalid licenses and zero relevance; in best-only mode reject any candidate missing a `required_terms` group; in thumbnail mode keep strict matches first and admit a near match only when exactly one group is missing and the finding query still has strong relevance (marked `identity_evidence: visual-verification-required`, never auto-promoted); then metadata-verified identity in the title outranks a URL-only match; concrete query tokens match whole ASCII tokens (`office` ≠ `officer`) and dominate generic words; orientation is a small penalty, no-attribution a small bonus, pixel count capped so a huge weak match cannot beat a smaller accurate one.

### `image_sources.json` format

Each successful download appends or replaces one entry keyed on `filename`; the file is written atomically and is idempotent, and an unreadable existing manifest blocks the write.

```json
{
  "license_verification": "provider metadata used; manual review recommended for external delivery",
  "generated_at": "2026-05-01T12:17:59.856275Z",
  "items": [ {
    "filename": "team.jpg", "slide": "03_team", "purpose": "Leadership photo",
    "search_query": "executive boardroom meeting", "matched_query": "leadership team boardroom",
    "selection_method": "metadata-ranked", "orientation": "landscape",
    "provider": "openverse", "stage": "all",
    "title": "Untitled", "author": "",
    "source_page_url": "https://www.rawpixel.com/...", "download_url": "https://...",
    "license_name": "CC0", "license_url": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",
    "license_tier": "no-attribution", "attribution_required": false,
    "width": 1024, "height": 683,
    "metadata_dimensions": { "width": 4800, "height": 3200, "note": "upstream-reported size; actual downloaded file is smaller (likely a preview)" },
    "attribution_text": "team.jpg — \"Untitled\" via Openverse — license: CC0 (...)",
    "status": "sourced"
  } ]
}
```

`matched_query` is the query or variant that found the asset; `selection_method` is `visual-thumbnail` after a reviewed promotion or `metadata-ranked` for the strict path; `width` / `height` are measured from the saved file (use them for layout) while `metadata_dimensions` appears only when the upstream claim differs; `license_tier` drives Executor's attribution; `attribution_text` is the canonical credit source, compressed only through §7's grammar; `stage` is `all` or `no-attribution-only`.

---

### Failure handling

Extends [`image-base.md`](../../references/image-base.md) §3. No candidates from any provider or stage → `Needs-Manual` (suggest a more precise query or another provider; rerun without `--strict-no-attribution` only when the page may carry credit). No acceptable image on the current page with `has_more_candidates` → fetch `next_candidate_page` without changing the query or downloading. A page past `candidate_total` → pool exhausted, add a variant or move to the manual boundary. Some previews fail while another qualifies → keep the set. Every preview fails, or a provider/network failure remains → `Failed`, retried by a later batch. A promoted original fails its download/readability/dimension gate → stay `Needs-Selection` and select another or change the query. A best-only download 403/404 → the dispatcher falls to the next ranked candidate. A keyed provider without a key → skipped. CLI exit: a prepared `Needs-Selection` set returns `0`; `Failed` or `Needs-Manual` returns `1`.
