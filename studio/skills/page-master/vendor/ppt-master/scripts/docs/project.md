# Project Tools

> **Import boundary**: move only sources already under the repository's
> `projects/` tree. Copy every other local path, even when `--move` is supplied.
> Use `--copy` to preserve a projects-local source.

Project tools create, validate, and inspect the standard PPT Master workspace.

## `project_manager.py`

Main entry point for project setup and validation.

```bash
python3 scripts/project_manager.py init <project_name> [--format <registered_format>]
python3 scripts/project_manager.py import-sources <project_path> <source1_or_dir> [<source2_or_dir> ...]
python3 scripts/project_manager.py scaffold-spec <project_path>  # optional manual helper
python3 scripts/project_manager.py scaffold-lock <project_path>  # optional manual helper
python3 scripts/project_manager.py validate <project_path>
python3 scripts/project_manager.py info <project_path>
python3 scripts/project_manager.py page-context <project_path> P07 [--pretty] [--record-usage]
python3 scripts/project_manager.py page-context-report <project_path>
```

Notes:
- A moved topic-research pair `projects/<slug>.md` takes its sibling
  `projects/<slug>_web_sources/` along to `analysis/research_web_sources/`.
- Local sources under `projects/` are moved into the target project unless
  `--copy` is passed; a file inside another project's tree is copied unless
  `--move` is explicit, so borrowing a finished project's slices never empties it.
- `--format` is optional and accepts registered canvas keys only. Pass it only
  when the actual canvas exactly matches a registered format.
- Without `--format`, `init` creates `<name>_<YYYYMMDD>`; a name that already
  ends in `_<YYYYMMDD>` is used as-is (no second date). Authoring records the
  canvas in `spec_lock.md` for Default Generate or the first SVG for Quick
  Generate.
- With `--format`, `init` preserves the registered form
  `<name>_<format>_<YYYYMMDD>` and normalizes aliases such as `xhs`.
- `init --quick-generate`: `svg_output/` plus
  `validation/workflow.log`; no README
- Files outside `projects/` are always copied into `sources/`
- `--move` applies only to sources under the repository's `projects/` tree
- A directly supplied supported bitmap is also copied into `images/` with a
  collision-safe basename while its original remains archived in `sources/`
- SVG/EMF/WMF inputs stay source assets unless a converter manifest supplies
  display metadata. Embedded Office vectors extracted from DOCX/PPTX land in
  `images/` with `image_manifest.json` as first-class image assets and are
  never converted to PNG; a blank browser preview of an EMF/WMF is expected.
  Export behavior for them: [`svg-pipeline.md`](svg-pipeline.md)
- Directory inputs are expanded non-recursively. After Step 1 conversion,
  pass the source file/directory once when generated Markdown lives beside the
  original source. If Step 1 used `-o` to write Markdown elsewhere, pass both
  the original source path/directory and the Markdown output path/directory.
- A projects-local supplied source directory left strictly empty after import
  (or empty from the start) is removed; every directory outside `projects/`
  remains untouched. `--copy` never removes directories.
- Files already under `projects/` move into `sources/` by default. Pass `--copy`
  to preserve them in place.
- `--move` and `--copy` are mutually exclusive.
- Normal Generate authoring reads `templates/design_spec_reference.md`, writes
  the complete `design_spec.md` from scratch, then reads
  `templates/spec_lock_reference.md` and writes the complete lock projection.
  It does not call either scaffold command.
- Optional `scaffold-spec` creates `design_spec.md` from
  `templates/scaffolds/design_spec.md`; `scaffold-lock` creates `spec_lock.md`
  from `templates/scaffolds/spec_lock.md`. Both substitute project/canvas
  metadata deterministically, require a registered format in the project
  directory name, and refuse to overwrite an existing artifact.
- `validate` parses the existing Markdown artifacts against
  `templates/schemas/design_spec.schema.json` and
  `templates/schemas/spec_lock.schema.json`. It reports missing sections and
  fields, including per-slide `Audience move` and `Relationships` lines,
  illegal enums, malformed page keys, and unmet conditional sections.
  When optional custom reference lists are present, it also requires every id
  to resolve to the matching mode, visual-style, or image-rendering catalog,
  rejects duplicates, and rejects reference rows on non-custom selections;
  under `## forbidden` on versioned locks, every non-empty, non-baseline list
  item must end with `(user)`;
  it does not rewrite either artifact or compare their values for textual
  equality. It also does not prove final-confirmation → Design Spec fidelity or
  Design Spec/context → lock semantic fidelity; Generate Step 4 owns those two
  gates before this structural validation. Validation reads the planning
  artifacts only and never reopens `confirm_ui/result.json`; the final result is
  consumed once into the Design Spec before validation begins. The design schema is structural lint for
  the human-readable brief; the lock schema owns machine execution values. For
  structured template use, strict input prototypes must match their assigned
  Master/Layout; adaptive input prototypes retain the assigned Master while a
  new output Layout already declared by Strategist is cross-validated after its
  generated SVG exists. Versioned
  Direct-authored current artifacts and optional scaffolds carry the schema
  marker. Markerless legacy artifacts are left on
  their prior validation path with a warning;
  malformed or unsupported markers are errors.
- PPTX-family inputs are enriched automatically under `analysis/` with
  per-deck `<stem>.identity.json` / `<stem>.slide_library.json` plus the shared
  multi-deck index `source_profile.json` (`decks[]`).
  Multi-deck per project: several PPTX imports each get their own `<stem>.*`
  artifacts and a `decks[]` entry; re-importing the same stem replaces its entry.

### On-demand page execution view

`page-context` projects `design_spec.md` and `spec_lock.md` into one compact
current-page view on stdout. The default command is read-only; `--pretty`
changes JSON formatting only. Before projection it revalidates the machine lock
and selected template-root identities; design-brief values are not treated as
a second lock. Slide headings at H3–H6 remain readable by the projector. Normal
generation retains the complete planning artifacts once per valid execution
context and does not invoke this command before every page; use it only for an
explicit diagnostic, routing check, or context-usage measurement.

Each invocation deliberately includes the bounded `global` anchor set as a
cross-page continuity view, not a color/font allowlist. `lock_source` binds that projection to the current
`spec_lock.md` SHA. `page_context` contains the current §IX brief, rhythm,
resources, and conditional template/chart assignment. `reference_set` contains
`kind`, scoped path, SHA, and `once-per-execution-context` policy for the
project/template Design Specs and selected prototype/chart SVGs. The project
Design Spec additionally carries
`same_context_edit_policy: targeted-readback-and-rebind`: when the current main
agent makes a bounded repair in a valid uncompacted context that preserves
roster/order/identity/communication, it reads back only the exact changed
fragments and validates them before continuing. Fresh, compacted, external,
unknown, or mismatched changes require one complete Design Spec and lock read.

The deprecated `--bundle` flag remains accepted as a compatibility no-op. It
never appends a Design Spec, prototype SVG, chart SVG, manifest, or text-slot
sidecar to stdout.

The projection keeps project-specific forbidden rules; universal SVG and icon
rules remain in the always-loaded execution core. Image rows are selected from
the current §IX brief, explicit §VIII page assignments, and mirror prototype
references. When those sources assign images elsewhere but not to the current
page, the view excludes those assigned images. Any still-unassigned legacy
image remains in a compatibility subset; `confirmed-none` is emitted only when
all locked images have a deterministic assignment elsewhere.

Mirror materialization may publish deterministic
`ppt-master.template-text-slots.v2-min` diagnostics. They are not page-context
or model inputs. The complete SVG remains the sole template authority; checker
and structured export validate output attributes, text/tspan topology, and
referenced-resource hashes against it internally.

`--record-usage` writes a derived snapshot to
`analysis/page-context/P<NN>.usage.json`. It hashes every input, measures the
exact compact stdout, and records the reference fingerprints. `tiktoken` is
loaded lazily with `o200k_base`; when unavailable, the command still succeeds
and records bytes, characters, hashes, and `tokens: null`.
`page-context-report` summarizes only fresh snapshots and identifies stale or
token-unavailable pages plus unique referenced files. Telemetry may be partial;
it does not measure once-loaded references, source reads, or other session
context.

Common formats:
- `ppt169`
- `ppt43`
- `xiaohongshu`
- `moments`
- `story`
- `banner`
- `a4`

Examples:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_manager.py init my_presentation
python3 scripts/project_manager.py validate projects/my_presentation_20251116
python3 scripts/project_manager.py info projects/my_presentation_20251116
python3 scripts/project_manager.py init my_widescreen --format ppt169
python3 scripts/project_manager.py scaffold-spec projects/my_widescreen_ppt169_20251116  # optional
python3 scripts/project_manager.py scaffold-lock projects/my_widescreen_ppt169_20251116  # optional
python3 scripts/project_manager.py page-context projects/my_widescreen_ppt169_20251116 P07 --record-usage
python3 scripts/project_manager.py page-context-report projects/my_widescreen_ppt169_20251116
```

## `workflow_transcript.py` and `workflow_log.py`

Project initialization creates `validation/workflow.log` and records its own
milestone. Run later project-scoped Python tools normally:

```bash
python3 scripts/<tool>.py <project_path> <args...>
```

Their shared CLI bootstrap discovers the existing project log from the working
directory or command arguments. `workflow_transcript.py` records a UTC command
envelope plus explicit error/failure and receipt/report lines, bounded
warning/OK/stderr samples, limited summary context, and per-run omission counts;
no outer launcher or second Python process is used. It leaves full output on
the original console instead of copying it into the audit log. Commands before
project initialization are not backfilled. Binary-buffer writes, hidden child
output, and detached service activity are not recorded; Confirm UI and live
preview retain detailed output in their component `server.log` files. Their
shared detached-process launcher disables automatic workflow recording in the
long-running child while preserving the short foreground launcher's own record.

For a Python helper whose arguments and working directory do not identify the
active project, set the routing signal on the same command:

```bash
PPT_MASTER_PROJECT_PATH="<project_path>" python3 scripts/<helper>.py <args...>
```

This variable selects only the destination transcript; it does not authorize
the helper to read project artifacts or change its ownership.

Append a manual note only when an important audit detail has no owning command
output:

```bash
python3 scripts/workflow_log.py <project_path> "<material audit detail>"
```

Suitable notes include a material stage handoff or rework reason, a
user-approved exception, or a manual recovery choice. Do not duplicate
artifact contents, routine page progress, or private reasoning.

The log is append-only audit evidence. It is not a complete console transcript,
stage, quality, or artifact authority and is not read during normal generation
or resume. Inspect it only when the user explicitly requests a run review. An
automatic recording failure emits a warning but does not change the Python
tool's result; an explicit manual entry that cannot be written exits non-zero.

## `project_utils.py`

Shared helper module used by other scripts.

Typical use:

```python
from project_utils import get_project_info, validate_project_structure
```

You can also run it directly for quick checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_utils.py <project_path>
```

## `batch_validate.py`

Batch-check project structure and compliance.

```bash
python3 scripts/batch_validate.py projects
python3 scripts/batch_validate.py --all
python3 scripts/batch_validate.py projects --export
```

Use this for multi-project health checks before release or cleanup.

## `generate_examples_index.py`

Rebuild the examples `README.md` index. The example projects live in the separate
[ppt-master-examples](https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master-examples) repository.

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_examples_index.py <path-to>/ppt-master-examples/examples
```

## `pptx_template_import.py`

Unified PPTX preparation entry point for `/create-template`.

```bash
python3 scripts/pptx_template_import.py <template.pptx>
python3 scripts/pptx_template_import.py <template.pptx> -o <output_dir>
python3 scripts/pptx_template_import.py <template.pptx> --manifest-only
python3 scripts/pptx_template_import.py <template.pptx> --skip-manifest
python3 scripts/pptx_template_import.py <template.pptx> --embed-images
python3 scripts/pptx_template_import.py <template.pptx> --inheritance-mode both
python3 scripts/pptx_template_import.py <template.pptx> --inheritance-mode flat
python3 scripts/pptx_template_import.py <template.pptx> --inheritance-mode layered
```

Notes:
- Extracts package resources into semantic workspace directories
- Summarizes slide size, theme colors, font metadata, and per-master theme metadata
- Resolves slide / layout / master relationships from OOXML relationships; every master and layout is included even when no sample slide currently references it
- Generates `analysis/manifest.json` (source facts and resource inventory), `analysis/native_structure.json`, `sources/source.pptx`, `validation/conversion-report.json`, populated semantic resource directories, and shape-level SVGs under `svg/`
- **SVG output defaults to the layered authoring source** (`--inheritance-mode layered`):
  - `svg/` — layered template view for designers: every master and layout in the deck rendered once as `svg/master_*.svg` / `svg/layout_*.svg` (including ones no sample slide currently references); `svg/slide_NN.svg` contains only that slide's own shapes; `svg/inheritance.json` records parentage plus source-owned `showInheritedShapes` / `showMasterShapes` booleans.
  - `svg-flat/` — optional verification view emitted only by `--inheritance-mode both`: each `slide_NN.svg` is self-contained (the effective visible Master/Layout contributions plus Slide-local content painted into one file), so opening any slide in isolation shows the full page like PowerPoint would. Background inheritance remains independent of inherited-shape visibility. Useful for previews, screenshots, and "did this slide actually render correctly" sanity checks.
- `analysis/manifest.json` records `svgFile` for slides / layouts / masters, `flatSvgFile` for slides when `svg-flat/` exists, placeholder type / index / geometry / base style, a resource map used by SVG `href` values, and common images reused through slide / layout / master inheritance. Placeholder semantics keep `subTitle`, `obj`, `media`, and `dt` distinct as `subtitle`, `object`, `media`, and `date`.
- `validation/conversion-report.json` owns tolerant source-recovery diagnostics; it is not a cache or a duplicate of the structural manifests
- Layered slide SVGs keep only the slide's own background; inherited master / layout backgrounds stay in the corresponding master / layout SVGs
- Placeholder guides are intentionally lightweight in `svg/` master / layout files; `svg-flat/` hides those guides and is the visual preview source
- Charts, SmartArt, diagrams, and OLE objects become typed placeholders in `svg/`; `svg-flat/` shows a preview image with a corner badge when one exists, otherwise a visible placeholder. Tables are converted into real SVG content.
- Pass `--inheritance-mode both` to add `svg-flat/`, or `--inheritance-mode flat` for a self-contained projection-only `svg/` tree without master/layout/inheritance files. Imported-deck round-trip uses the separate `authoring-svg-flat/` contract.
- SVG export reads OOXML directly via `pptx_to_svg` — no PowerPoint or Keynote dependency, runs on any platform
- `<image>` elements in `svg/` reference files in `images/` directly; raster images and SVG/EMF/WMF image media share that directory. Pass `--embed-images` to inline them as data URIs instead.
- External linked images and missing media are strict failures. Office vector media such as EMF / WMF are converted to PNG previews when the local toolchain can do so; otherwise the import fails instead of silently dropping content.
- Required in `/create-template` whenever the reference source is `.pptx`
- Default output directory is `<pptx_stem>_template_import/`
- Use `--manifest-only` when you explicitly want only the lightweight import output without slide SVG export
- Intended for template reference preparation, not for final 1:1 template delivery

Implementation note:
- Internal helpers for this workflow live under `scripts/template_import/`
