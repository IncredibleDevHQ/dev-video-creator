# Native Preset Shape Vocabulary

This is Executor's complete authoring-side map of the 187 registered DrawingML
preset names. Read it once, completely, with the executor core before the first page
(Generate) or at authored-mode entry (Create Template). The Office categories and family descriptions expose what exists and
what each contour objectively depicts; the current page's meaning, visual
system, and composition determine whether and how to use it.

**Reference — not a constraint**: the order and families are browse aids, not
rankings, recommendations, whitelists, quotas, or automatic selections. A
primitive, compound construction, necessary freeform, or no drawn carrier may
still be the best result.

**Hard rule — registered identities and behavior boundaries**:

- `flowChart*` names carry conventional flowchart meanings; they are not generic decorative nodes.
- `actionButton*` names provide visual button geometry only; they create no action, hyperlink, or navigation target.
- `bentConnector*` and `curvedConnector*` are connector contours, but newly authored instances have no endpoint attachment.
- `chartX`, `chartStar`, and `chartPlus` are partition symbols, not data charts.
- Literal pictograms and mathematical operators retain the identity named here.

**When to run**: run `preset_shape_svg.py describe <name> --compact` only when
an exact candidate needs objective adjustment, connector, path,
connection-site, or text rectangle facts (`--frame X Y W H` adds the text rectangle in page px; ribbon, chevron, arrow, and callout bodies hold far less text than their frame, so read that rectangle before sizing a label). Authoring syntax and fragment
contracts remain in
[`native-shape-authoring.md`](./native-shape-authoring.md).
