# Image_Searcher Reference Manual

Role definition for the **web image acquisition path**: translate the resource owner's intent into keyword queries, search openly-licensed providers, download one license-cleared image into `project/images/`, and record provenance and license in `image_sources.json`.

**Trigger**: the Default resource list contains `Acquire Via: web`, or Quick has resolved a required web image in active context.

---

## 1. License Tier Discipline

Every provider-sourced image lands in one of two tiers; everything else is rejected. `manual` exists only for a directly selected `--from-url` replacement or an adopted-page package image — never for a provider result with an unknown license. Downstream consumers read `license_tier` alone and never interpret raw license strings.

| Tier | Licenses | On-slide attribution |
|---|---|---|
| `no-attribution` | CC0, Public Domain, Pexels License, Pixabay Content License | None |
| `attribution-required` | CC BY, CC BY-SA | Inline credit `<text>` on the slide |
| `manual` | Directly selected URL or adopted-page image, license unverified | None — rights and any credit are the user's responsibility |

**Forbidden — auto-rejected**: CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-ND, All Rights Reserved, unknown or missing license.

---

## 2. Search Strategy

Quality first across all allowed tiers — never prefer CC0 over a better CC BY image; the manifest's `license_tier` lets Executor add credit only when needed. `--strict-no-attribution` (CC0 / PD / Pexels / Pixabay only) is opt-in for decks that cannot carry any on-slide credit.

```
Multimodal Generate: explicit query variants × provider chain + allowed licenses
         → aggregate/deduplicate/rank → first 8 thumbnails → visually select
         → download one original; if none passes, inspect the next 8 first.
Non-visual / standalone best-only: explicit query variants × provider chain
         → strict metadata gate → first downloadable ranked original wins.
```

## 3. Providers

| Provider | Config | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| Pexels | `PEXELS_API_KEY` (free, [signup](https://www.pexels.com/api/)) | modern stock photography, people, workplace, lifestyle |
| Pixabay | `PIXABAY_API_KEY` (free, [signup](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)) | broad coverage including illustrations; its API serves at most a 1280 px long edge, so prefer Wikimedia or Pexels for full-bleed heroes |
| Openverse | zero-config | fallback aggregator: Wikimedia + Flickr + museums + rawpixel |
| Wikimedia Commons | zero-config | educational, scientific, geographic, historical; pin `provider: wikimedia` for murals, manuscripts, artworks, and museum objects, which stock providers tag with tourist snapshots |

Default chain: `pexels` → `pixabay` (each when keyed) → `openverse` → `wikimedia`; a keyed provider without a key is silently skipped. Configure Pexels or Pixabay when stock coverage serves the brief; their absence is never a failure.

---

## 4. Intent → Query Translation

| Layer | Owner and grammar |
|---|---|
| Default `design_spec.md §VIII Reference` / Quick active `Reference` | The owner's complete visual intent — exact subject, view/mood, focal or quiet region, crop safety, positive quality cues — fixed for the run and never rewritten by this role |
| `image_queries.json.items[].query` / positional query | This role's concrete entity keyword string: the shortest phrase that preserves identity, keeping exact multi-word names and disambiguators even beyond four words; no mood, quality, composition, HEX, or negative wording |

Web APIs match metadata, not intent: providers try each explicit query, then progressively simplified four/three/two/one-word variants, so keep a concise primary `query` plus `query_variants` for materially different official translations, spellings, aliases, or Chinese names (never cosmetic word-order changes); for Chinese landmarks pair the Wikimedia Chinese name with compact English identity terms. A candidate either satisfies the existing intent or the role tries materially different query/provider/license strategies until none remain, then marks `Needs-Manual`; never loosen `required_terms`, the license policy, or the intent to manufacture a match.

**Hard rule — `required_terms` for exact entities** (landmarks, people, companies, products, venues, named artworks and institutions): write them with the query — one group per identity anchor, `|` for aliases, e.g. `["Chongqing|重庆", "Jiefangbei|解放碑|Liberation Monument"]`. Never loosen them to category words (`canyon`, `stone pillar`, `ancient town`, `bridge`, `temple`); those belong in the query, and a small or local attraction that metadata cannot prove ends in `Needs-Manual` or a user `--from-url`, never a plausible image of the wrong place. Never use them for generic mood rows ("modern city skyline", "team collaboration"). **Forbidden — negative words** (`not tourist snapshot`, `no amateur photo`): keyword APIs search them literally.

| §VIII Reference (intent) | Provider query |
|---|---|
| "Offshore wind farm at dusk, aerial view, quiet sky on the left for safe crop" | `offshore wind farm` |
| "Diverse engineering team around a laptop, modern office, natural light" | `engineering team laptop` |
| "Chongqing Jiefangbei monument, full structure visible, landscape frame" | `Chongqing Jiefangbei monument` |

## 5. Running `image_search.py`

```bash
python3 scripts/image_search.py "<query>" --filename <name>.jpg --slide <slide_id> \
  --orientation landscape --purpose background -o <project_path>/images
```

Every flag, its default, and its exact behavior: [`image.md`](../scripts/docs/image.md) § `image_search.py`.

**Batch mode (≥2 web rows) — preferred**: write every row into `image_queries.json` and run one concurrent batch (the web sister of `image_gen.py --manifest`); add `--save-candidates` whenever the agent can inspect images:

```bash
python3 scripts/image_search.py --batch <project_path>/images/image_queries.json -o <project_path>/images --save-candidates
```

```json
{ "items": [ {
  "filename": "jiefangbei.jpg",
  "query": "Jiefangbei Chongqing downtown monument",
  "query_variants": ["Chongqing Liberation Monument", "重庆 解放碑"],
  "slide": "03_landmark", "purpose": "exact landmark photo", "orientation": "landscape",
  "required_terms": ["Chongqing", "Jiefangbei|Liberation Monument"],
  "status": "Pending"
} ] }
```

Required per item: `filename`, `query`, `status`; optional: `query_variants`, `candidate_page`, `slide`, `purpose`, `orientation`, `provider`, `strict_no_attribution`, `min_width`, `min_height`, `required_terms`. The runner revalidates `Sourced` rows, searches every `Pending` / `Failed` row concurrently, writes `Needs-Selection` with paging fields in thumbnail mode, and saves status after each completion; ranking orders provider metadata, never pixels, and is not a taste engine — exact runner and ranking behavior: [`image.md`](../scripts/docs/image.md).

**Suitability review** — a top hit is downloadable and token-relevant, not visually suitable (the reviewer receives only the locked row intent plus candidate sidecars/sheets, never the full planning or acquisition context):

- **With vision**: `--save-candidates` saves at most the first 8 ranked previews under `candidates/<stem>/review/` and the sheet; run [`web-image-review.md`](../workflows/stages/web-image-review.md) — one isolated reviewer for the batch when available, otherwise local review — then only the image owner promotes the returned filename. Never promote the least-bad candidate; if none passes and `has_more_candidates` is true, fetch `--candidate-page 2` before changing the query. For exact entities, `required_terms` gates metadata and the review image confirms the pixels show the subject and satisfy the focal/crop intent; a generic `required_terms` pass is not acceptance (matching `Ground Fissure` can return an unrelated station named Yunlong).
- **Without vision**: omit `--save-candidates`; the tool excludes near matches, downloads only the first candidate passing every strict metadata, license, and dimension gate, and records `selection_method: metadata-ranked` — never described as visual confirmation. With no strict candidate, or an intent that needs a viewpoint, crop, expression, or fine identity metadata cannot establish, mark `Needs-Manual`; Quick opens no interaction.

**Replacement ladder**: (1) with vision, promote the one passing thumbnail; (2) with `has_more_candidates`, fetch the next page (numbering continues globally — page 2 starts at `candidate_09`); (3) after the pool is exhausted, add materially different identity/translation/alias/viewpoint/disambiguation variants and generate a fresh pool; (4) with vision only, after normal search is exhausted, fetch one adopted `source_url` as a Markdown + companion-image package under [`topic-research`](../workflows/stages/topic-research.md) § Hand-off, copy one passing image into `images/`, and reconcile the row and `image_sources.json` from its `image_manifest.json` entry with `license_tier: manual` (never auto-expand facts URLs or promote the whole package); (5) manual URL replace — `python3 scripts/image_search.py --from-url <image-url> --filename <name>.jpg -o <project_path>/images` — recorded `manual`, only with a URL already supplied in Quick; it updates the image and `image_sources.json` but not `image_queries.json`, so validate the file and reconcile the query row and roster to `Sourced` before export ([`executor-web-image.md`](./executor-web-image.md) §1); (6) when variants, pages, providers, license stages, and the package fallback are exhausted, mark `Needs-Manual`. This review never opens an acquisition-time interaction ([`image-base.md`](./image-base.md) §3): Default may continue to Step 6 with a placeholder; Quick blocks direct export when the image is required.

**Standalone thumbnail selection** (opt-in outside Generate):

```bash
python3 scripts/image_search.py "<query>" --filename <name>.jpg -o <project_path>/images --save-candidates
python3 scripts/image_search.py --promote candidate_03.jpg --filename <name>.jpg -o <project_path>/images
python3 scripts/image_search.py "<same query>" --filename <name>.jpg -o <project_path>/images --save-candidates --candidate-page 2
python3 scripts/image_search.py --promote candidate_03.jpg --filename <name>.jpg --batch <project_path>/images/image_queries.json -o <project_path>/images
```

Previews land in `images/candidates/<stem>/review/` with a thumbnail-only `candidates.json` (page, size, total, `has_more_candidates`, matched query, identity evidence) and `review_sheet.jpg` for the current round; the target and manifest stay untouched until promotion.

---

## 6. Manifest (`image_sources.json`)

Each successful download appends or replaces one entry keyed on `filename` (written atomically; an unreadable existing manifest blocks the write). `license_tier` drives Executor's attribution, `attribution_text` is the canonical credit source, `width` / `height` are measured from the saved file, and `selection_method` records `visual-thumbnail` or `metadata-ranked`. Complete field list and example: [`image.md`](../scripts/docs/image.md).

---

## 7. On-Slide Attribution Contract

For `license_tier: attribution-required`, every slide using the asset carries a visible, readable credit bound unambiguously to it, preserving author, source/provider, and CC BY / CC BY-SA facts from `attribution_text`. Position, size, color, per-image versus combined credits, labels, and contrast treatment belong to the page — a compact credit near the image edge or footnote area for one image, per-image credits or one labeled combined line for several, a quiet region (a scrim or gradient only when contrast fails) on a hero. Compress without dropping required facts: `team.jpg — "Untitled" via Openverse — license: CC0 (...)` → `via Openverse / CC0`; `team.jpg — "Sunset" by Jane Doe via Wikimedia Commons — license: CC BY-SA 4.0 (...)` → `© Jane Doe / Wikimedia / CC BY-SA 4.0`.

---

## 8. Failure Handling (web-specific)

Extends [`image-base.md`](./image-base.md) §3 through the replacement ladder in §5: exhausted candidates and variants end in `Needs-Manual` with a reason, provider or network failures stay retryable `Failed`, and a promoted original that fails its gate stays `Needs-Selection`. Exit codes and per-case runner behavior: [`image.md`](../scripts/docs/image.md).

---

## 9. Handoff with the Intent Owner

`Reference` is intent, not a query ([`image-base.md`](./image-base.md) §1): keep it intact as the acceptance contract, derive a separate concise provider query that preserves exact names and disambiguation, and never pass it verbatim or rewrite it after search.

## 10. Handoff with Executor

Executor reads `image_sources.json` per slide and acts on `license_tier` — `no-attribution` and `manual` embed the `<image>` only, `attribution-required` adds the §7 credit — without interpreting license strings. `svg_quality_checker.py` verifies that every referenced attribution-required image has its own visible author + license credit; one deck-level CC token never covers several images.

## 11. Task Completion Checkpoint

Beyond [`image-base.md`](./image-base.md) §4: every required web row is `Sourced` with its original at `project/images/<filename>` or `Needs-Manual` with a reason (`Needs-Selection` is incomplete); each multimodal `Sourced` image came from a bounded thumbnail page whose winner alone was downloaded, with remaining pages exhausted before any query change; without vision only strict metadata candidates became `Sourced` with `selection_method: metadata-ranked`; each `Sourced` row has a valid `license_tier` and non-empty `attribution_text` (except `manual`); every attribution-required image has its credit in every referencing SVG; `metadata_dimensions` warnings were surfaced when the download was far smaller than claimed.
