# Page Transitions & Per-Element Animations

Execution contract for generated-PPTX **page transitions** and **per-element object animations**, including deterministic Morph pairing: defaults, sidecar semantics, anchor selection, validation, and package read-back.

## Capability Menu — Open Here

Motion is several separate capabilities, not one dial; two of them are decided while pages are still being authored, so read this before the page plan is frozen.

| What the deck needs | Reach for | Decided at |
|---|---|---|
| A generic deck-wide entrance build | `-a auto`; with the default `after-previous` Start, groups use fixed `--animation-stagger` timing, not narration cues | Post-processing; §2, §4 |
| Explicit object lifecycle choreography | An `animations.json` sidecar for selected enter/emphasize/move/exit/static duties, order, Start, timing | Post-processing; §2, §4, [`customize-animations`](../workflows/stages/customize-animations.md) |
| Object reveals synchronized to recorded narration | Narration-cue sync derives `narration_animations.json` from `animations.json`, page-local SRT, and `narration_timing.json`; `-a auto` alone does not | Audio stage; [`generate-audio`](../workflows/stages/generate-audio.md) |
| A continuous action — slide-in, flip, camera push-in, progressive reveal, camera pan | **Morph: author the action as two static pages**, then select Morph and add explicit pairs when identity must be deterministic; there is no keyframe timeline anywhere — the difference between two editable slides *is* the animation | **Page authoring (Step 6), then motion post-processing** — §2.1, §3.1 |
| A static full-bleed page that should stop looking frozen | Slow `path_*` motion on a visually subordinate image or atmospheric layer | Post-processing; §4.1 |
| Carousel, counting numerals, parallax depth, click-to-reveal flip card | Four recipes assembled from the mechanisms above; carousel and odometer need paired pages | §4.2 |
| Kiosk or unattended playback | `--auto-advance <seconds>`, optionally with `-t none` | Export; §3 |
| A transition or object animation needs an audible cue | Optional `transition.sound` or object `sound`, selected only after the visual solution is complete and synced from the global library; a narrated MP4 uses either the verified native-export mix or explicit slideshow capture, never both | Post-motion; §2.2 |
| Nothing should move | `-t none` and per-element `none` | Export; §1 |

**Hard rule — Morph geometry is an authoring decision; pairing is a later execution decision**: export cannot invent endpoint states. Author both consecutive pages while `svg_output/` is being built. For deterministic identity expose each endpoint as a compatible direct-root group and declare the pair in `animations.json` (§2.1); ids and geometry may differ. `-t morph` without pairs leaves matching to PowerPoint's heuristic.

**Reference — not a constraint**: per-element animation stays off by default; auto-firing builds on every page are an unsolicited "AI deck" tell, and each capability earns its place per page.

## 1. Defaults

| Layer | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Page transition | CLI `fade`, 0.4s (the public Python builder keeps its legacy 0.5s) | Calm baseline |
| Per-element animation | **`none` (off)** | A page appears as a whole; opt in with `-a auto` or one explicit `entrance_*` / `emphasis_*` / `path_*` / `exit_*` key |
| Sound effects | **`none` (off)** | No global sound is copied and no `<project>/sounds/` exists until a resolved cue selects one |

To regenerate with different settings, rerun the final checker when its report is absent or stale, then rerun `svg_to_pptx.py` on the same `svg_output/`; the authoring LLM reruns only for SVG repair. `-s final` is diagnostic only.

---

## 2. Custom Object-Level Animation

`-a auto` enables generic entrance reveals deck-wide with no config. A specific lifecycle — enter, move, emphasize, exit — uses the optional `animations.json` sidecar: the SVG stays the visual source, the custom stage may regroup, rename, and re-bound anchors without changing visible output, and the sidecar controls PPTX behavior.

**When the custom stage runs**: run [`customize-animations`](../workflows/stages/customize-animations.md) when `animations.json` exists, when the user asks to tune order/effects/timing/object reveals, or when the effective Custom Animations outcome in `design_spec.md §I` is enabled. A §IX `Motion suggestion` informs an active pass but never triggers it.

**Hard rule — semantic anchors before object-targeted entries**: derive motion units and duties from page meaning and narration, regroup coarse or fragmented Slide-local content without changing appearance, and target only post-regroup top-level ids.

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py list-groups <project>   # real anchors after regrouping
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py scaffold <project>      # neutral editable scaffold (effect: none, {} placeholders)
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py validate <project>      # before export
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project>                    # reads <project>/animations.json automatically
```

Sparse sidecar (unlisted slides inherit resolved defaults):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "slides": {
    "03_threshold": {
      "groups": {
        "risk-marker": {
          "effects": [
            { "effect": "entrance_fade", "order": 1, "duration": 0.25 },
            { "effect": "path_right", "effect_options": { "relative": true }, "order": 2, "duration": 0.7 },
            { "effect": "emphasis_teeter", "order": 3, "duration": 0.45 },
            { "effect": "exit_fade", "order": 4, "duration": 0.3 }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Contract**: `slides` keys are SVG stems and `groups` keys are top-level `<g id>` anchors.

| Element | Rule |
|---|---|
| Populated group | Either the legacy single-effect object or `{ "effects": [row, …] }`, never both |
| `{}` | A neutral placeholder |
| Legacy `effect: none` | Removes the group from the sequence |
| Row fields | `effect`, `order`, `delay`, `duration`, `trigger` / `trigger_shape`, `effect_options`, and the repeat / reverse / timing-ratio / restart / after-effect / sound modifiers |
| Inheritance | Unlisted slides and omitted fields inherit `defaults` and then the CLI |
| `--animation none` | Disables all per-element animation |
| `--no-animations` | Also removes transitions |

The complete field grammar, inheritance, and validation are [`pptx-animations.md`](../scripts/docs/pptx-animations.md) §8; `pptx_animations.py --describe <effect>` prints each effect's exact options.

### 2.1 Deterministic Morph Object Pairing

When one semantic object continues across adjacent slides, the destination slide declares forced-Morph pairs — separate from `groups` (Morph owns cross-slide identity; `groups` owns Animation Pane rows) — following Microsoft's [forced object-matching convention](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/morph-transition-tips-and-tricks):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "slides": {
    "02_detail": {
      "transition": { "effect": "morph", "effect_options": { "morph_by": "object" }, "duration": 0.8 },
      "morph": { "from": "01_overview", "pairs": { "hero-image": { "from": "hero-overview", "to": "hero-detail" } } }
    }
  }
}
```

| Pairing rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Owner | `morph` belongs to the destination; `morph.from` is the immediately preceding stem in export order |
| Source of pairs | `scaffold` never guesses identity — add pairs from the motion plan after inspecting final direct-root ids |
| Pair key | A stable identity whose `from`/`to` are unique direct-root `<g>` ids on the two slides, written without `!!` (export writes the Selection Pane name `!!<key>` on both); a root primitive with a static role marker is not pairable, neither is a `Native-ready=yes` chart or table — `--native-charts-and-tables` turns it into a graphicFrame and the pair fails at export — nor a `data-pptx-placeholder` slot on a structured page, which export rewrites into a layout placeholder; pair a Slide-local group there |
| Destination effect | A destination with pairs sets `effect: morph` explicitly (`morph_by` omitted or `object`; `word`/`character` rejected; a CLI override that changes the effect fails) |
| Chains | A middle slide may continue an object into another Morph under the same key |
| Uniqueness | One key never names two objects on a slide; one object never carries two keys; every `!!` key shared by adjacent Morph pages must be declared |
| Coexistence | Pairing coexists with in-slide animation and survives `-a none`; `--no-animations` disables everything |
| Verification | Export verifies every pair and fails rather than falling back ([`pptx-transitions.md`](../scripts/docs/pptx-transitions.md) §3.2) |

### 2.2 On-Demand Sound Selection

**Hard rule — select after motion, materialize after selection**: sound is not a Strategist resource and never appears in `design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`, or pre-SVG preparation. After the roster and motion solution are final, and only when a specific cue is selected: read the complete [`sound-vocabulary.md`](../templates/sounds/sound-vocabulary.md), choose one exact id for the auditory job, sync only that id, and reference the project-local `sounds/<namespace>/<file>.wav`. User audio already in the project is referenced by its project-relative path (`.m4a` / `.mp3` / `.wav` for objects, `.wav` for transitions). With no concrete cue job omit `sound` and create no `sounds/`.

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/sound_sync.py list --query <term>                       # optional exact filtering after the vocabulary is in context
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/sound_sync.py <project_path> <namespace>/<sound_id> [...]  # materialize only the chosen ids
```

`sound_sync.py` is the only library materialization path; the exporter never reads `templates/sounds/`, and sidecars store paths, not ids.

**Default — silence**: never add sound to demonstrate capability or for coverage; a sound supports a named transition, reveal, confirmation, warning, or gesture after that visual behavior is selected.

**Hard rule — PPTX and MP4 are separate deliveries**: sound fields and read-back prove the PPTX carries the cue, not that PowerPoint's encoder put it in the MP4. A narrated MP4 with cues follows `generate-audio` — mix from the final narrated trace plus final PPTX, or capture the live Slide Show with system audio, never both — and keeps gain/limiter settings out of `animations.json`.

---

## 3. Page Transitions

**Reference — not a constraint**: choose from the relationship between adjacent pages, not gallery coverage — relate (same object or space, directional advance, new section, deliberate break), diagnose the job (continuity, cut, direction, object/state continuity, spatial movement, thematic beat), select the smallest family, coordinate direction, duration, and recurrence with reading order and narration, and keep `fade` or `none` when nothing adds meaning.

| Page relationship | Candidate family |
|---|---|
| Ordinary continuation within one section | `fade` |
| Immediate change with no continuity to preserve | `none` or `cut` |
| Directional steps, timeline, or layer progression | `push` / `wipe`; `cover` / `uncover` for a visible overlay relationship |
| The same object or scene changes across adjacent pages | `morph`; §2.1 pairs for deterministic identity |
| Section opening, key reveal, or marked state boundary | Selective `split` / `reveal` / `shape` / `flash` / `random_bars` |
| A repeated collection advances through one spatial frame | `pan` / `conveyor` / `ferris_wheel`; the §4.2 Morph carousel for deterministic cards |
| The viewpoint travels around or through a continuous space | `rotate` / `window` / `orbit` / `fly_through` |
| A stage, paper, or physical-page metaphor | Selective `fall_over` / `drape` / `curtains` / `wind` / `prestige` / `peel_off` / `page_curl` / `airplane` / `origami` / `doors` |
| Breakage, collapse, or dispersal | Selective `fracture` / `crush` / `dissolve` / `vortex` / `shred` |
| A geometric, timed, or textured reveal | Selective `checkerboard` / `blinds` / `clock` / `ripple` / `honeycomb` / `glitter` / `comb` |
| A card, panel, gallery, or viewpoint visibly turns | Selective `switch` / `flip` / `gallery` / `cube` / `box` / `zoom` |
| Unpredictability itself is requested | `random`; never for variety |

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -t push --transition-duration 0.6
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -t none
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> --auto-advance 5            # kiosk playback
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -t none --auto-advance 5
```

**Registry**: PowerPoint's complete Subtle, Exciting, and Dynamic Content gallery — 48 canonical keys (`pptx_animations.py --list`); old low-level names normalize to a native key plus options and are never selected for new output. `transition.effect_options` exposes each effect's real Effect Options (`pptx_animations.py --describe-transition <effect>`); `transition.sound` (a `.wav` synced under §2.2) may accompany `effect: none`.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-t/--transition` | Default `fade`; `none` keeps an explicit auto-advance |
| `--transition-duration` | Default `0.4` |
| `--auto-advance` | Seconds; click still advances |

**Hard rule — no silent downgrade**: an unknown effect, unsupported option, or invalid duration fails export and is never replaced by `fade`. Carrier XML, MCE fallbacks, and read-back: [`pptx-transitions.md`](../scripts/docs/pptx-transitions.md).

### 3.1 Morph — author an action as the difference between two pages

Morph tweens matched objects across consecutive slides, so any continuous action is two static pages plus Morph: duplicate the page, change one property, PowerPoint interpolates. Chain three or more pages for extend–hold–retract.

| Property change | Reads as |
|---|---|
| Off-canvas → on-canvas | Slide-in, drawer, card extending |
| Rotation | Flip, turn, hinge |
| A scaled image container | Camera push-in |
| A dropping scrim or growing cut | Progressive reveal |
| The same wide image at two `x` offsets | Camera pan (`#C2-01`) |

**Reference — continuity carriers**: the Morph most decks need is not an action but a carrier — one object that persists across pages and re-seats: a progress axis or station marker that travels to the current stop, a hero figure that shrinks into the next page's header, a title band that hands one page's identity to the next. Carriers orient the reader, their endpoints are the same kind by construction, and one key chains them through a whole section (§2.1 Chains).

**Hard rule — matching needs compatible identity, not identical geometry**: prefer §2.1 pairs; ids and visible state may differ, but both endpoints must resolve to one compatible top-level PowerPoint object kind — a shape and a picture cross-fade instead of tweening. Automatic Morph is heuristic.

**Give text somewhere to come from**: text present only on the second page can only fade in — place the next page's copy just below the canvas and the previous page's just above, so blocks slide through the frame. A wholly off-canvas endpoint is one direct-root `<g id>` with valid `data-pptx-bounds` and `data-pptx-morph-staging="true"`, explicitly paired when Morph stays enabled; the marker never excuses a partially clipped group. Declare identity through the destination's `morph` block, never `data-pptx-shape-name` (importer metadata, [`svg-effects.md`](./svg-effects.md) §6.6).

**Not supported**: Slide Zoom / Summary Zoom (build click navigation with `trigger_shape` or hyperlinks) and 3D — perspective, extrusion, and shear fail closed ([`svg-effects.md`](./svg-effects.md) §6.8); build the impression with offset, scale, overlap, and per-facet lightness.

## 4. Per-Element Animations

Off by default; enable with `-a auto` (or another effect), select a canonical effect with `--animation entrance_fade`, and choose Start with `--animation-trigger on-click|with-previous|after-previous` — PowerPoint's Start dropdown.

| Start | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `on-click` | Each click reveals the next group; only for a controlled semantic reveal; forbidden with `--recorded-narration` |
| `with-previous` | One coordinated beat; stagger ignored |
| `after-previous` | Default click-free cascade with `--animation-stagger` |

**Default — one dominant deck rhythm and normally one mode per slide (may mix for a distinct simultaneous or presenter-controlled beat)**. Row-specific `trigger_shape` is PowerPoint's separate Trigger → On Click of, not a fourth mode.

**Mandatory — lifecycle before effect**: start from `static`, classify `initial → action → end`, then choose the effect; generic staged reveals are `enter`, narrower jobs select their lifecycle.

| Duty | State contract | Use when | Effect family |
|---|---|---|---|
| `static` | present → hold → present | Motion adds no clarity or feeling | No row; legacy `effect: none` only suppresses inheritance |
| `enter` | absent → introduce → present | Information is withheld, ordered, or revealed with narration | `entrance_*`; modes only for generic reveal |
| `emphasize` | present → redirect attention → present/altered | A visible object must regain attention or show a local change; never its first reveal | Explicit `emphasis_*` |
| `move` | A → progress → B | The trajectory carries spatial or causal meaning, or §4.1 ambient motion; Morph for cross-page continuity | Explicit `path_*`, or endpoint pages + Morph |
| `exit` | present → retire → absent | The same slide must remove, replace, or make room; a page change needs no exit | Explicit `exit_*` |

**Default — restrained entrance-led choreography (may override for content, tone, or the request)**: entrances for ordinary builds; emphasis or exit only for a real duty; several `effects[]` rows only for several duties.

**Registry**: **203 native object presets** — `entrance_*`, `emphasis_*`, `path_*`, `exit_*` (`pptx_animations.py --list` prints the categorized keys); 29 legacy short names normalize before selection and are never written. Modes handle generic `enter` only: `auto` maps semantic ids to canonical entrances, `mixed` cycles a deterministic pool, `random` samples it with a stable seed; none satisfies an adopted `emphasize`, `move`, or `exit`. Flags (`-a`, `--animation-trigger`, `--animation-duration`, `--animation-stagger`, `--animation-config`, `--no-animations`) and their narration interactions: [`pptx-animations.md`](../scripts/docs/pptx-animations.md) §3 and [`svg-pipeline.md`](../scripts/docs/svg-pipeline.md).

### 4.1 Slow ambient motion — the page that breathes

**Reference — not a constraint**: `path_left` / `path_right` on a background image, started `with-previous` and paced far slower than a content reveal, keeps a static page from feeling frozen while staying subordinate. The same applies to any non-information-bearing layer, with duration, distance, and moving-object count from the composition. A full-bleed moving image must cover the canvas at both endpoints. With a fixed foreground (`#M1-07`, also `#M1-10`, `#P1-09`) the scrim and its cuts stay locked while the world moves behind them — windows, not a sliding photo. Coordinated layers are valid for one depth or atmosphere relationship; competing paths or motion that hurts copy or data are not.

### 4.2 Recurring recipes

- **Carousel** (Morph, §2.1/§3.1): hold a fixed row of card frames and rotate the content through them one position per page, pairing each moving content unit; frames stay static and unpaired.
- **Odometer** (Morph or path): a vertical 0–9 strip shown through a window of background-filled rectangles (`#M1-08`); shift the strip so the target digit lands, then morph or `path_up`; a `0.1s` stagger settles columns in sequence, and synchronized motion is also valid when it fits the intended rhythm.
- **Parallax depth** (Morph): move the background a short distance and the foreground a longer one; keep z-order identical on both pages or the tween jumps.
- **Flip-card / click-to-reveal** (`trigger_shape`): a face group and a back group at the same position, face with an exit and back with an entrance whose `trigger_shape` is the face's id — the supported click-driven route (Zoom objects are not, §3.1).

---

## 5. Anchor Logic — Top-Level `<g id="...">`

Animations anchor on unique top-level `<g id>` content groups (`cover-title`, `card-1`). A single-effect group yields one Animation Pane row, `effects[]` several, each inheriting the slide Start unless it declares `trigger`; nested groups stay anonymous and untargeted.

**Hard rule — existing groups are not custom-animation intent**: during the custom stage derive one group per logical motion unit from claims, comparisons, sequence, causality, and narration — splitting coarse wrappers and merging fragments without changing appearance, never to hit a count — and run `list-groups` only after that rewrite.

**Chrome stays static by default**: a `data-pptx-layer` group is structural and never animates, and a full-canvas background rect becomes the slide background, which cannot animate either. A static role/placeholder marker or a chrome-name id (background, header/footer, decor, watermark, page number, nav, logo, or a bare `rule` / decorative-line `hairline-rule`; a content group such as `commit-rule` is not chrome) keeps a group out of automatic animation and the scaffold; a sidecar entry that names it animates it — a background field panning (§4.1), a cover band sliding in — judged per page, never by category. Wrap logical sections in `<g id>` ([`shared-standards-core.md`](./shared-standards-core.md) §4.3); a root with no top-level group falls back to a bounded primitive set ([`svg-pipeline.md`](../scripts/docs/svg-pipeline.md)).

---

## 6. Validation and Read-Back

Export rejects an unknown effect, mode, or trigger, invalid timing or order, a missing slide, group, or `trigger_shape`, and any structural-layer target, then reads every slide back and compares it with the request; nothing is downgraded or omitted. The complete rules, the reverse projection `pptx_to_svg.py` writes into `animations.json`, and what read-back does not prove (final-video audio) are [`pptx-animations.md`](../scripts/docs/pptx-animations.md) §6 and [`pptx-transitions.md`](../scripts/docs/pptx-transitions.md) §6.

---

## 7. Video Adaptation Contract

Video renderers consume the resolved conversion trace through `video_motion_plan.py` ([`video-motion-plan.md`](../scripts/docs/video-motion-plan.md)), never a raw sidecar; the plan locks identity, order, effect, direction, and timing.

## 8. Limitations

- Generated animation belongs to the native PPTX built from `svg_output/`; `svg_final/` is static and inserting it creates no anchors.
- PowerPoint OOXML is the compatibility target; other apps may reinterpret behavior trees.
- PowerPoint's MP4 encoder may drop transition and object sounds, so sound-enabled MP4 uses the post-export mix or the capture contract.
- Direct-PPTX routes preserve unknown transition `AlternateContent` and keep Choice/Fallback advance attributes synchronized.
