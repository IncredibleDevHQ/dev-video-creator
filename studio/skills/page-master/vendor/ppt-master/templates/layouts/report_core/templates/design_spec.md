# Report Core — Design Specification

## IV. Signature Design Elements

Report Core provides a structural vocabulary for paginated 16:9 material that is
read as much as it is presented: reviews, analyses, and evidence-carrying
decks whose pages need to be citable and navigable. The neutral prototype paint
exists only to expose hierarchy and slot geometry; it is not an identity
segment. Color, typography, logo, voice, and icon treatment remain downstream
decisions.

| Element | Template-specific behavior |
|---|---|
| Two Masters, two background planes | `report_core_content_master` carries the light reading plane plus persistent chrome; `report_core_divider_master` carries an inverted plane with no chrome, used by `cover`, `section_divider`, and `closing`. The reusable structural fact is that the roster owns two independent background planes and two Theme parts — not the specific prototype hex values, which remain replaceable preview paint. |
| Persistent page chrome | The content Master owns a header hairline at y 64 and a footer hairline at y 664 as static atoms repeated on every content page. Divider pages carry neither, so a section break reads as a genuine interruption rather than a restyled content page. |
| Page numbering is structural | Every content Layout declares a `slide-number` slot at `1112 676 120 32` and a `footer` slot at `48 676 900 32`; `cover` declares a `date` slot. These enable the matching Layout header/footer flags so the compiled package carries real numbering capability instead of drawn text. |
| Tightened frame | Margins are 48 px and the title band is `48 88 1184 56` at 28 px, against a 64 px margin and 36 px title on a breathing general system. The content field runs y 176 to y 640 on every content page. |
| Rules before containers | Grouping is carried by hairlines wherever it can be: `agenda` separates its five rows with rules and Layout-owned `01`–`05` indices, and `appendix` uses a single column rule with no panel at all. Filled panels appear only where a region genuinely needs a distinct material plane. |
| Density ladder | Body text steps from 20 px on single-region pages, to 19 px in split panels, to 18 px in step and evidence regions, down to 15 px in `appendix`. Chrome text sits at 12 px. The ladder is what lets one system carry both a synthesis page and a reference page without changing frame. |
| Analytical page types | `kpi_row` places four metrics across the full 1184 px field, which this canvas width supports without compressing them. `matrix_2x2` adds four quadrant slots plus two axis-label slots for positioning arguments. `chart_insight` and `table_summary` declare typed `chart` / `table` slots whose authored groups remain complete SVG fallbacks; their replacement markers become PowerPoint-native data objects, so a deck that uses either layout exports with `--native-charts-and-tables`. |
| Text entry | General body and object slots begin at the upper-left. Centered alignment is reserved for KPI values, short process nodes, and the timeline takeaway. |
