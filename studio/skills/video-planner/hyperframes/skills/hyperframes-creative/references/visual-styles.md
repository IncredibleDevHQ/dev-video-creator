# Visual Style Library

Named visual identities for HyperFrames videos. Each style is grounded in a real graphic design tradition and expressed as a DESIGN.md-compatible token block. Use them as starters — copy the YAML into your project's `design.md` front matter, then customize.

**How to pick:** Match mood first, content second. Ask: _"What should the viewer FEEL?"_

**How to use:** Copy the style's YAML token block into `design.md` front matter. Add `## Overview`, `## Colors`, `## Typography`, `## Elevation`, `## Components`, `## Do's and Don'ts` prose sections to complete the file.

```

Grid-locked compositions. Every element snaps to an invisible 12-column grid. Numbers dominate the frame at 80–120px. Animated counters count up from 0. Hard cuts, no decorative transitions. Nothing floats.

```

Generous negative space. Symmetrical, centered, architectural precision. Thin sans-serif, ALL CAPS, wide letter-spacing. Sequential reveals with long holds. Nothing snaps — everything glides with intention. Luxury takes its time.

```yaml
name: Deconstructed
colors:
  primary: "#1a1a1a"
  on-primary: "#f0f0f0"
  accent: "#D4501E"
typography:

    hold: 1.0
    transition: 0.5
  atmosphere:
    - scan-lines
    - glitch-artifacts
    - grain-overlay
  transition: glitch
```

Type at angles, overlapping edges, escaping frames. Bold industrial weight. Gritty textures: scan-line effects, glitch artifacts baked into design. Text SLAMS and SHATTERS. Letters scramble then snap to final position. Intentional irregularity — nothing should feel polished.

## 4. Maximalist Type — Paula Scher

**Mood:** Loud, kinetic | **Best for:** Big product launches, milestone announcements, high-energy hype videos

```yaml
name: Maximalist Type
colors:
  primary: "#0a0a0a"

  accent-red: "#E63946"
  accent-yellow: "#FFD60A"

    fontFamily: Space Grotesk
    fontSize: 3rem
    fontWeight: 700
rounded:
  none: 0px
spacing:
  sm: 0px
  md: 8px

    hold: 0.8
    transition: 0.4
  atmosphere:
    - type-layers
    - color-blocks
  transition: ridged-burn
```

Text IS the visual. Overlapping type layers at different scales and angles, filling 50–80% of frame. Bold saturated colors — maximum contrast. Everything kinetic: slamming, sliding, scaling. 2–3 second rapid-fire scenes. No static moments. Fast arrivals, hard stops.

    - particle-field
    - light-traces
    - radial-glow
  transition: gravitational-lens
```

Thin futuristic sans-serif — floating, weightless, minimal. Fluid morphing compositions. Extreme scale shifts (micro → macro). Particles coalesce into numbers. Light traces data paths through the frame. Smooth, continuous, organic. Nothing hard.

## 6. Soft Signal — Stefan Sagmeister

**Mood:** Intimate, warm | **Best for:** Wellness brands, personal stories, lifestyle products, human-centered apps

```yaml

    transition: 1.5
  atmosphere:
    - soft-gradient
    - warm-grain
  transition: thermal-distortion
```

Handwritten-style or humanist serif fonts. Personal, lowercase, delicate. Close-up framing: single element fills the frame. Slow drifts and floats, never snaps. Soft organic motion. Nothing should feel hurried or polished. Intimate, never corporate.

    transition: 0.8
  atmosphere:
    - pattern-tiles
    - confetti-burst
    - color-blocks
  transition: swirl-vortex
```

Bold warm rounded type. Pattern and repetition — folk art rhythm and density. Layered compositions with rich visual texture. Every frame feels handcrafted. Colorful motion: elements bounce, pop, spin into place with joy. Overshoots feel intentional. Celebratory energy.

## 8. Shadow Cut — Hans Hillmann

**Mood:** Dark, cinematic | **Best for:** Security products, dramatic reveals, investigative content, intense launches

```yaml
name: Shadow Cut
colors:
  primary: "#0a0a0a"
  on-primary: "#f0f0f0"
  surface: "#3a3a3a"
  accent: "#C1121F"
typography:
  headline:
    fontFamily: Oswald
    fontSize: 4rem
    fontWeight: 700
    textTransform: uppercase
  body:
    fontFamily: Inter
    fontSize: 0.875rem
    fontWeight: 400
rounded:
  none: 0px
  sm: 2px
spacing:
  sm: 8px
  md: 16px
  lg: 48px
motion:
  energy: moderate
  easing:
    entry: "power3.out"
    exit: "power4.in"
    ambient: "sine.inOut"
  duration:
    entrance: 0.8
    hold: 2.5
    transition: 1.2
  atmosphere:
    - deep-shadow
    - vignette
    - grain-overlay
  transition: domain-warp
```

Near-monochrome: deep blacks, cold greys, stark white + one blood accent. Sharp angular text like film noir title cards. Heavy contrast, no softness. Elements emerge from darkness — reveal is the narrative. Slow creeping push-ins, dramatic scale reveals. The pause before the hit matters. Domain Warp dissolves reality before the next scene.

## Creating Custom Styles

These 8 styles are starters — not constraints. Create your own:

1. **Name it** after a designer, art movement, or cultural reference
2. **Write YAML tokens** — `colors` (2–5 tokens), `typography` (2–3 scales), `rounded`, `spacing`, `motion` (energy + easing + duration + atmosphere + transition)
3. **Add prose** — one paragraph describing the feel, what to do, what to avoid
4. **Token references** — use `{colors.accent}`, `{typography.headline}` in component definitions

The pattern: **YAML tokens (what) → prose rationale (why) → components (how they combine).**
