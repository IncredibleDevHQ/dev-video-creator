# Vertical Spring Ticker (Slot Machine)

Multiple spring tweens are ADDED TOGETHER to produce total Y translation — each spring contributes one discrete "step", so instead of a single linear scroll you get the slot-machine "click click click" rhythm with natural settling. Distinct from a continuous marquee: this rule's semantics are discrete steps that land; for endless linear motion see [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md).

## How It Works

A masked window of fixed height `ITEM_HEIGHT` (`overflow: hidden`) holds a vertical stack of items, each exactly `ITEM_HEIGHT` tall. Each spring holds a 0→1 progress; a shared `onUpdate` sums them and applies `translateY(-sum × ITEM_HEIGHT)`. Springs fire sequentially with overlap (`STEP_SPACING ≤ STEP_DUR`), so each step snaps in while the previous is still settling — that overlap is what makes them additive, and the `back.out` overshoot is what makes each step read as a "click".

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="ticker" id="ticker">
  <div class="stack-inner" id="stack-inner">
    <div class="item">{item0}</div>
    <div class="item">{item1}</div>
    <div class="item">{itemN}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.ticker {
  width: TICKER_WIDTH;
  height: ITEM_HEIGHT; /* MUST match .item height exactly */
  overflow: hidden; /* the mask is the window */
}
.stack-inner {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* mandatory — vertical stacking */
}
.item {
  height: ITEM_HEIGHT; /* MUST equal .ticker height */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  /* font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; — for numeric tickers */
}
```

```js
const innerEl = document.getElementById("stack-inner");
const springs = Array.from({ length: STEPS }, () => ({ p: 0 }));

function applyTransform() {
  const sumP = springs.reduce((acc, s) => acc + s.p, 0);
  innerEl.style.transform = `translateY(${-sumP * ITEM_HEIGHT}px)`;
}
applyTransform(); // initial state

springs.forEach((spring, i) => {
  tl.to(
    spring,
    {
      p: 1,
      duration: STEP_DUR,
      ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})`,
      onUpdate: applyTransform,
    },
    STEP_START + i * STEP_SPACING,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Numeric ticker (price / counter rolling)** — items are the digit sequence; run the same spring-step pattern per decimal position. `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` required.
- **Reverse direction (countdown)** — flip the sign (`translateY(${sumP * ITEM_HEIGHT}px)`) and arrange items in reverse order.
- **Pause between groups** — several fast steps (small `STEP_SPACING`), a long pause, then one dramatic final step with a bigger `BOUNCE_FACTOR`. The pause is where the eye locks in.
- **Continuous infinite ticker** — NOT this rule (this rule is discrete steps); a looping news ticker is a single linear tween with duplicated items — see [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for continuous-motion semantics.

## Values

| token         | range                 | notes                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ITEM_HEIGHT   | ~`fontSize × 1.25`    | must hold capital descenders; `.ticker` height MUST equal it exactly                  |
| TICKER_WIDTH  | 30–60% viewport width | wide enough for the longest item without ellipsis                                     |
| STEPS         | 1–4                   | number of transitions, not items; `STEPS ≤ itemCount − 1`                             |
| STEP_DUR      | 0.3–0.7s              | under 0.3 the overshoot is invisible; over 0.7 the click reads as a slide             |
| STEP_SPACING  | 0.3–0.5s              | **≤ STEP_DUR** so springs overlap (additive); wider gaps read as a lazy linear scroll |
| BOUNCE_FACTOR | 1.4–2.5               | 1.4 gentle click / 2.0 firm / 2.5+ casino spin-and-land for a climax step             |

## Critical Constraints

- **Container height = item height, pixel-exact, all items equal** — mismatches show partial item edges above/below the mask and accumulate drift across steps.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the container, not the inner stack**; `flex-direction: column` on the stack.
- **Sum the springs in `onUpdate` — never tween the final position directly.** Each spring contributing its OWN snap is the slot-machine pacing.
- **Overlap steps and keep `back.out` per step** — non-overlapping steps or an out-only ease collapse into a linear scroll.
- **Never update items via `innerHTML` between steps** — the ticker moves the SAME items via translate; swapping content shows the previous item AS the new one (broken illusion).
- **Climax dwell ≥1s after the final step** (SKILL universal constraint).
- **`tabular-nums` for numeric tickers** — variable digit widths break alignment.
