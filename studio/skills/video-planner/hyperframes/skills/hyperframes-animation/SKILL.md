# HyperFrames Animation

All motion knowledge in one skill: **rules** (atomic recipes), **blueprints** (multi-phase scene templates), **transitions** (scene-to-scene), **techniques** (broader motion-design patterns), and **adapters** (per-runtime APIs).

For the composition contract (data attributes, sub-compositions, determinism) see `hyperframes-core`.

## Default: compose atomic rules

Pick 2-4 rules from `rules-index.md`, glue them together with a single paused GSAP timeline, done. This is faster and produces less code than starting from a blueprint.

## Load a blueprint when

- The scene matches an existing pre-designed multi-phase template (brand-reveal, social-proof, etc.) and reusing its phase pipeline saves real authoring time
- You want runnable ground-truth code for a complex 4-5 phase choreography

Blueprints live in `blueprints-index.md`. Each entry points to `blueprints/<id>.md` (recipe). Do not read it speculatively; load it when you've already decided you need scene-level orchestration.

## Picking a runtime

- **GSAP** is the default for 95% of motion work — covers timeline orchestration, transforms, easing, stagger. All atomic rules in this skill are GSAP-based.
- **Lottie** when an asset has its own pre-baked timeline (typically After Effects exports).
- **Three.js** for 3D scenes, camera motion, shader-driven visuals.
- **Anime.js** for lightweight tweening when GSAP is overkill.
- **CSS** for simple repeated motifs, decoration, shimmer — no JavaScript animation cost.
- **WAAPI** for native browser keyframes without a GSAP dependency.
- **TypeGPU / WebGPU** for GPU-rendered canvases (particles, liquid glass, custom shaders).

Multiple runtimes can coexist in one composition. Each registers its instances on the runtime-specific global so HyperFrames can seek all of them in one pass.

## Critical Constraints

**Prerequisite: `hyperframes-core` → Non-Negotiable Rules** (single paused timeline, `data-duration` governs length, no `Math.random` / `Date.now` / `performance.now`, no `repeat: -1`, no page-load `gsap.set` on later-scene clips, no `display` or raw `visibility` tweens, and no timeline construction inside `async` / `setTimeout` / `Promise`). GSAP `autoAlpha` and zero-duration visibility sets at explicit timeline boundaries remain allowed by core. Use those exceptions only on non-clip elements or wrappers inside a clip; the framework owns `.clip` lifecycle. Don't restate the full contract here.

Animation-craft additions on top of core's contract:

- **Pre-calculated layout constants** — never derive positions from `getBoundingClientRect()` at tween time. Tween-time DOM measurements desync because the renderer samples in parallel; compute coordinates once at composition setup and reuse.
- **Spatial motion uses GSAP transform aliases only** (`x`, `y`, `scale`, `rotation`). Core's allowlist also permits `opacity` / `color` / `backgroundColor` / `borderRadius` for non-spatial property tweens — but never `width` / `height` / `top` / `left` for layout changes.

## Scripts

```bash
node skills/hyperframes-animation/scripts/animation-map.mjs <composition-dir> \
  --out <composition-dir>/.hyperframes/anim-map
```

Reads every GSAP timeline registered on `window.__timelines`, enumerates tweens, samples bboxes, computes flags, outputs `animation-map.json`. Use it to audit choreography (dead zones, stagger consistency, lifecycle warnings) after authoring.

`animation-map.mjs` resolves helper packages from the current project first, then can bootstrap the bundled HyperFrames package version. Set `HYPERFRAMES_SKILL_PKG_VERSION=<version>` only when running the skill outside the bundled CLI/skill install and you need to pin that bootstrap version explicitly.
