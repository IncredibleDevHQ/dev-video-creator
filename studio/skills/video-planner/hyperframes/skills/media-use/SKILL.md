name: media-use
description: Agent Media OS, the single skill for every media need in a HyperFrames project. Resolve BGM, SFX, image, icon, brand logo, voice, color grade, or LUT into a frozen local file or paste-ready block + ledger record (one verb, `resolve`); generate via TTS / music / image models when the catalog misses; produce voiceover, transcription, captions, and background removal through one shared audio engine; operate on media (cut / reframe / transform); and reuse assets across projects. Also use for vague feedback that real footage looks dark, flat, boring, should feel retro/camcorder/print/ASCII, needs privacy, or needs a media reveal.

# media-use

The media OS for HyperFrames: resolve · generate · operate · remember — every media type, one skill, zero context noise.

First run: install and sign in to the `heygen` CLI (the free-usage path), then verify with `npx hyperframes media-use resolve --doctor`. Setup and providers: `references/setup-providers.md`.

## Resolve — the one verb

```bash
npx hyperframes media-use resolve --type <type> --intent "<description>" --project <dir>
```

Returns one line: `resolved <id> → <path> (<type>, <metadata>)`. All search noise stays on disk.

| Type    | One-line intent                                                                     |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bgm`   | background music (HeyGen catalog, 10k+ tracks)                                      |
| `sfx`   | sound effects (bundled 19-file library + catalog)                                   |
| `image` | photos, backgrounds (HeyGen asset search, 75k+ vectors)                             |
| `icon`  | icons, symbols (transparent)                                                        |
| `logo`  | official brand marks (svgl → simple-icons → GitHub avatar → favicon; never redrawn) |
| `voice` | TTS voiceover (HeyGen free-usage path; optional local Kokoro)                       |
| `grade` | measured correction candidate; broad polish/stylization follows Media Treatments    |
| `lut`   | user-provided or explicitly chosen reusable validated `.cube` file                  |

Before resolving fresh, list reusable candidates with `--candidates` and judge fit yourself — reuse rules, all flags, ingest (`--from`), and adopt are in `references/resolve.md`.

## Treat broad visual feedback as media intent

When a user explicitly asks to fix, polish, stylize, obscure, emphasize, or
reveal photographic media, read `references/media-treatments.md` even if they
do not name color grading or an effect. Inspect the real `<img>`/`<video>`,
choose one primary intent, then use deterministic persistence and verification.
Use a matching recipe as an optional tested seed, or inspect
`hyperframes media-treatment --capabilities --json`, then request one relevant
family/effect with `--capability <id>` and assemble a custom treatment from
canonical controls. Never load `--all` for ordinary authoring. A treatment may
compose correction, a preset, finishing, compatible shader effects, supported
keyframes, and optional Registry overlays. Add only source-justified bounded
tuning and compatible parts, never effects merely to make the result look more
sophisticated. Persist the final combined payload with
`hyperframes media-treatment`.

Use one progressively escalating workflow. For video, inspect one labeled
early/middle/late contact sheet rather than reading frames separately. Apply one
candidate and inspect one after-sheet for ordinary correction or polish.
Escalate to individual frames or moving draft evidence only when the result is
ambiguous, temporal, stylized, LUT-based, HDR/LOG-sensitive, private, or
brand-critical.

For ordinary correction or polish, persist the final treatment's
preset/adjustment JSON.
Do not generate a `.cube` LUT merely to encode exposure, shadows, contrast, or
warmth. Use a LUT only when the user supplies one or the selected treatment
explicitly owns one. `resolve --type grade --for ... --analyze` is measurement
evidence, not permission to replace the chosen treatment with a generated LUT.
Do not recreate supported vignette, grain, blur, pixelate, color, or treatment
effects with CSS/SVG overlays; that bypasses Studio controls and the canonical
preview/render shader path.

## Be proactive — run a media opportunity pass

The human usually can't tell which media would lift the piece. You can. When you build or review a composition, do **one** grounded scan and then **ask once** — don't silently add, and don't nag per asset.

Surface an opportunity only when a concrete signal is present:

| Signal detected                                          | Offer                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| On-screen text / a script with no voiceover              | TTS voiceover (audio engine)                                                                           |
| Emoji or a `<div>` styled as an icon                     | resolve real `icon`s                                                                                   |
| Image that is a placeholder, tiny, or upscaled-looking   | a better `image` (and/or upscale — see `references/operations.md`)                                     |
| Hard scene cuts / transitions with no sound              | transition `sfx`                                                                                       |
| A piece over ~10s with no music bed                      | `bgm`                                                                                                  |
| Footage that reads under/over-exposed or color-cast      | a corrective grade (inspect it with `hyperframes media-treatment --selector '#hero' --analyze --json`) |
| Photographic media that feels visually flat or off-topic | one specific source-appropriate preset or custom treatment, with the intended target named             |
| A meaningful media entrance/reveal that feels static     | one supported seek-safe treatment animation; preserve color unless the request also justifies a preset |

Rules that keep this a help, not nagware: **grounded, not generic** (no signal → no suggestion); **opinionated + concrete** (propose the specific fix with defaults chosen — the human approves **all / some / none**); **once per project** (one consolidated ask; respect "leave it"); **surface, never silently mutate** (color grades especially: propose and preview — a gray-world "correction" ruins an intentional sunset or neon look).
