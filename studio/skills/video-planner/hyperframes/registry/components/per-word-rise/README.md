# per-word-rise

Words or characters rise into place in a controlled blur-to-sharp cascade, settle with a short decel tail on landing, and hold truly still until the frame cuts.

3.5s authored, elastic HOLD, exit `none` by default.

## Variables

| id       | type   | default           | notes                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`   | string | `WORDS IN MOTION` | The displayed line. Font size auto-fits to character count.                                                                                                                        |
| `split`  | enum   | `word`            | `word` or `char`: the unit that rises.                                                                                                                                             |
| `cues`   | string | `` (empty)        | Comma-separated seconds (from mount start) for each unit's landing, e.g. `0.4,0.8,1.6`. Units beyond the list extrapolate at the list's own gap. Empty keeps the authored cascade. |
| `accent` | enum   | `green`           | Text color: green rides `--brand`, blue rides `--accent`, violet rides `--accent-2`.                                                                                               |
| `exit`   | enum   | `none`            | `none` holds until the cut; `fade` departs opacity-only; `up` is the staggered upward fade (the pre-Wave-J default ending).                                                        |

## Mount

```html
<div
  class="clip"
  data-composition-id="per-word-rise"
  data-composition-src="./per-word-rise.html"
  data-variable-values='{"text":"SHIP IT TODAY","split":"word","cues":"0.5,1.0,1.5"}'
  data-start="0"
  data-duration="3.5"
  data-track-index="0"
></div>
```

Elastic root: no `data-width`/`data-height`; it fills whatever box the host clip gives it. Timeline registers under the literal `per-word-rise` key.

## Notes

- Cues are landing times: each unit's rise ends on its cue (start compresses toward 0 for early cues). Landings clamp ahead of any exit.
- Deterministic and seek-safe; the hold is truly still (no drift), and every landing ends with a short overshoot-free settle tail instead of a dead stop.
